 <h2 id="_i3" class="section-heading-2">1. Introduction</h2>
 <p>In recent years, we have witnessed an increasing number of crises worldwide, triggered by climate extremes, natural and human-made hazards, the coronavirus pandemic, and more. Those crises pose a high pressure globally for integrative emergency, crisis, and disaster management, empowered by using spatial information from various sources. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is a valuable source as it contains multiple, up-to-date crisis-related information.</p>
 <p>The need for fast and effective decision-making has driven the development of spatial technologies (Mansor et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>). The use of spatial data and technologies in crisis management is crucial. Spatial data is used to assess the consequences of an incident, identify the population at risk and inform them promptly, and identify the best ways and routes of escape. Decision-makers have used technology to make numerous tasks more manageable, and recently it has also been used in helping cities become more informed, more prepared, and thus more resilient (GAR <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). Advances in information communication technologies can lead to advanced systems’ efficiency of emergency management and accuracy by using modern data processing techniques (Xu, Sugumaran, and Zhang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0061" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) and new data sources such as VGI provided from, for example, vulnerable groups or people at risk (Tzavella, Fekete, and Fiedrich <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Emergency managers incorporate vital spatial components to assess the potential hazard impact or identify the best evacuation routes during disasters (Cova <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>). Generally, with the help of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), spatial indicators are applied to calibrate and manage phenomena such as climate change, natural hazards, deforestation, land-use change, fires, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis (Fekete et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0012" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) in most cases using data from official agencies and data banks (local, national and international).</p>
 <p>However, VGI offers the possibility of exploiting real-time information that can be used in the early stages of assessing a crisis, assisting the response phase, and later determining the damage in considerable detail. This information can be helpful in emergencies, resulting in improved situational awareness, response time, and enhanced resilience. For example, people experiencing disasters could still have the ability to share messages and spatial information via different platforms, voluntarily supplying information regarding the affected areas (Goodchild and Glennon <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) to cope with uncertainty (Palen and Anderson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0041" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). Such platforms are social media (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), mobile applications (e.g. WhatsApp), collaborative platforms, or in situ and mobile sensors (Palen and Anderson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0041" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Goodchild and Glennon <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Tzavella, Fekete, and Fiedrich <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). The current tasks of social media-based research include disaster identification and spatiotemporal analysis, assessment of disaster intensity, sentiment analysis, fake news identification, communication node analysis, and information display (Tang and Wang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>).</p>
 <p>In general, in the last decade, there has been a trend shift in disaster management toward Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) based approaches (Sood and Sood <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>), where big data, information, and communications technology in disasters see an increasing interest (Freeman et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). An integrative review by (Freeman et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) revealed that social media and GIS are two of the four most frequently mentioned tools within disaster management and communications technology, including patient health information during and after a disaster and disaster modeling.</p>
 <p>Since its introduction, VGI has attracted massive research interest (Juhász, Adam, and Jamal <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0024" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Connors, Lei, and Kelly <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Klonner et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). Researchers have verified evidence of VGI use in crisis, emergency and disaster management frameworks through systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses covering up to fifteen years of research and knowledge (Reuter and Kaufhold <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0047" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). This paper aims to explore the use of VGI in crisis management, including emergency and disaster management, based on a scoping review of existing literature for several years. In this article, verified cases of VGI use in crisis, emergency and disaster management are geolocated, and thus a spatial bibliography is provided. Finally, an interactive and viable (i.e. updatable) web atlas created further permits the publication of the research results to a broad audience and their visualization with several interactive maps. The paper is organized as follows: <a href="#s0002">Section 2</a> provides additional background about VGI and crisis, emergency, and disaster management, presents the existing literature reviews on the subjects, and introduces the research plan; <a href="#s0003">Section 3</a> describes the methods applied; <a href="#s0004">Section 4</a> presents the analysis and the results, <a href="#s0005">Section 5</a> presents the web map application, that is, the VGICED Atlas, where various interactive layers of information are provided to the users, and <a href="#s0006">Section 6</a> discusses the results and suggests plans for future research with recommendations for the scientific community and policymakers.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i5">2.1. VGI for crisis, emergency and disaster management</h3>
  <p>VGI is a relatively new source of spatial information utilized in social media-based research, crisis monitoring, and decision-making. It features instant information and specific content (Tang and Wang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>) in unstructured and structured forms. Specifically, VGI is the use of digital tools to collect, analyze, and disseminate geographic information provided by individuals (Ferster et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>); or else crowdsourced. VGI was introduced as a term in 2010 (Goodchild and Glennon <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) as crowdsourcing information, and it has become one of the top priority research topics in GIScience for the decade from 2007 to 2017 (Yan et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0062" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). Specifically to their utilization in crisis, emergency and disaster management, this kind of information produced, extracted from, or disseminated by social media was also introduced as “crisis informatics” (Hagar <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Further, the term was expanded (Hughes and Leysia <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>) and has gained increasing interest since then (Reuter, Amanda, and Kaufhold <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Crisis informatics is the interconnectedness of people (or a crowd), organizations, technology, and information during crises, examining the intersecting directions of social, technical, and information perspectives in various crises (Hagar <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>). The term views emergency response as an expanded sociotechnical system where information is disseminated between official media, public media, and multiple entities. Under the term VGI, researchers study the use of information and technology in the mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery phases of crises, disasters, and other emergencies (Palen et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>), where timely information retrieval and exchange are critical. In this article, the term VGI used is the one adopted as introduced in Tzavella, Fekete, and Fiedrich (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Therefore, VGI is <i>“the voluntarily exchangeable information that includes any geographic and spatial information provided by the population (before, during and after a crisis) and is available through different VGI platforms. i.e. OpenStreetMap, social media platforms, mobile applications, and more”</i>. Therefore, when discussing VGI in this article, collected, analyzed, and exchanged structured and unstructured information is taken into consideration.</p>
  <p>A single dimension cannot define crisis management because of the multiplicity and complexity of humanitarian crises, including human-made and natural disasters (Jeong and Yeo <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Examples of humanitarian crises include natural and climate-induced disasters (such as floods, flash floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires), human-made disasters (such as wars, oil spills, terrorist attacks), compound impacts (such as forced migration, decreased food security, famines) and other emergencies (such as epidemics, pandemics). Crisis management is implemented in a specific context through broad risk analysis, incident identification, prevention, enhanced preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. Therefore, there is high interconnectedness and, on many occasions, overlap in the broad aspects of a crisis, emergency and disaster management cycle. Internationally accepted definitions and terms of crisis, emergency, and disaster are found in <a href="#app0001">Appendix A</a> in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0005">Table A1</button>. The terms crisis and disaster are closely related and share more features than the term emergency, depending on the situation (Al-dahash, Thayaparan, and Kulatunga <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). Despite the sudden and, most times, unpredictable nature of crises, emergencies, and disasters, there are attempts to understand the nature and different character of such terms. The reason is to be correctly used in the primary literature stream. It is observed in the literature that many relevant studies are context and term-specific, making literature reviews challenging to collect relevant to the subject research studies (see <a href="#s0002-s2002">section 2.2</a>). This article uses the crisis as the general umbrella of crisis, emergency, and disaster. Mainly, crisis management aspects are analyzed with an awareness of the often overlapping terms of disaster and emergency management.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i6">2.2. Existing reviews on VGI in crisis management</h3>
  <p>Various literature reviews have been conducted over the years to investigate VGI use in crisis management. Due to the vast number of studies, longitudinal research can be performed, even if it phases challenges such as the rapid evolvement of social media platforms and a change in the context in which the platforms are used. Therefore, the researchers must distinguish between generalizable findings and those related to a specific social media platform or crisis context (Reuter, Amanda, and Kaufhold <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Longitudinal studies make observation changes more accurate and can answer questions for specific periods regarding the type of crisis/event that VGI is used, the phase of the crisis management cycle, the platform on that VGI is produced and disseminated, and more. Most studies are term and topic-directional restricted. For example, the researchers focus on one term, i.e. “crisis” (De Longueville et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Luokkala and Kirsi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0031" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Palen et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0043" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Reuter, Amanda, and Kaufhold <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Saroj and Pal <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0048" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Stieglitz et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0055" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), or “disaster” (Gao, Barbier, and Goolsby <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>; Haworth and Eleanor <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Tang and Wang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Kankanamge et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; McDougall <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Nilupaer <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Scholz et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0049" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Zook et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0063" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). Additionally, the researchers use the terms “social media” or “crowdsourcing” or focus on one or more management phases of such overlapping management cycles, with most focusing on “situational awareness/preparedness” (Luokkala and Kirsi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0031" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Vieweg et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0059" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Seppänen and Virrantaus <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0051" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Vongkusolkit and Huang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0060" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Horita and João <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), “response phase” (Goodchild and Glennon <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Meesters, van Beek, and Van de Walle <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0034" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>) and “disaster relief” (Gao, Barbier, and Goolsby <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>; Poiani et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Zook et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0063" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). Further, VGI-related literature reviews focus on specific VGI sources with a preference for social media platforms such as Twitter, which is the most popular due to the accessibility of data (Hughes and Leysia <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>; Vieweg et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0059" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Shanley et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0052" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). A systematic literature review shows that the relatively more diverse VGI research topics investigated over a more extended period in North America and Europe, compared with other regions of the globe, highlight the significant problems studied across the VGI research network (Yan et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0062" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>).</p>
 </div>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i7">2.3. Research plan</h3>
  <p>This paper is based on a scoping literature review. A systematic review typically tries to answer a focused research question with narrow parameters and usually fits into the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) question format. On the other hand, a scoping review tries to answer a broad question with more complex, exploratory research questions and often does not fit into the PICO question format.<a href="#en0001"><sup>1</sup></a> A critical difference between scoping and systematic reviews is that in terms of a review question, a scoping review will have a broader “scope” than traditional systematic reviews with correspondingly more expansive inclusion criteria (Munn et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0037" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Additionally, the general goal of conducting scoping reviews is to identify and map the available evidence (Arksey and Lisa <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>; Anderson et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Literature reviews’ results can be coupled with geolocation to introduce the spatial character of bibliography research. Spatial bibliographies, i.e. online collections of georeferenced context-specific literature bodies, assist the research on such multidisciplinary and multidirectional studies. The benefits of researching georeferenced media are outlined in the literature (Howell et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), including accessibility benefits (Karl, Gillan, and Herrick <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), reduced redundancy, decreased bias toward underrepresented areas, and providing solid ground on which meta-analysis can be based (Karl <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Information on location in published studies represents an untapped resource for discovering literature and applies to various domains (Karl <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). For example, location knowledge can promote collaborations among authors and researchers in geographically separate areas worldwide, advance science, and address sustainability challenges. However, search tools’ thematic and not geographic nature makes location-based searches challenging and inefficient (Page <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0039" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Building on the experience of a previous spatial scoping study, some of the authors of this article (Skopeliti and Katerina <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0053" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) have conducted a geolocated context-specific longitudinal study through a literature review on VGI use in disaster management in 2018, where the geolocated results were presented in maps to assist further place-based research.</p>
  <p>In the present research framework, a scoping review of spatial character is combined with the geolocation of the results, as in a spatial bibliography. Thus the term “<i>Spatial Scoping Review</i>” is introduced. Specifically, in this article, crisis, emergency and disaster are used as the main terms of our literature search to analyze the use of VGI in crisis, emergency and disaster management among global, multidirectional and multidisciplinary studies identified. Further, the authors do not proceed to a quality assessment of the studies, as it is a practice in systematic literature reviews (Arksey and Lisa <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). The aim is to review all types of research for the last five years to a) assist further meta-analyses, b) avoid redundancies in the researched subject, c) promote international collaborations, and d) advance policymaking by providing information on additional information sources, mining methods, and tools.</p>
  <p>To the authors’ knowledge, no scoping review has been conducted to identify, collect, and visualize the vast multidisciplinary literature on VGI use in crisis, emergency and disaster management in a multi-term, global and multidirectional context with an interactive web atlas. Precisely, the authors, after the definition of broad scoping review questions, a) assess the extent of the available evidence in this more general context-specific research, b) organize it into groups utilizing research-specific criteria after selecting keywords with various methods and tools, and c) visualize it, providing a spatial georeferencing citation tool and further recommendations for future research.</p>
  <p>The research aims to answer the following Scoping Review Questions (SRQ):</p>
  <p>SRQ1:Is VGI used in crisis, emergency, or disaster management, and what is the spatial distribution of scientific interest (e.g. international)?</p>
  <p>SRQ2:Which VGI sources are utilized (e.g. OpenStreetMap – OSM, Crowdsourcing, Twitter, USHAHIDI)?</p>
  <p>SRQ3:For which hazard types (e.g. natural and human-made hazards, pandemic) and for which task in crisis, emergency, or disaster management is VGI utilized (e.g. situational awareness, preparedness, response, recovery)?</p>
  <p>SQR4:Has VGI been used to manage actual crisis events, e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic, and Hurricane Katrina?</p>
  <p>Finally, the authors aim to investigate the geovisualization of the findings of this spatial scoping review with several interactive maps in the framework of a web atlas (see <a href="#s0006">section 6</a>) to provide a viable and updatable spatial georeferencing tool disseminating the results of the analysis according to the SRQs mentioned above available to the scientific community and policymakers.</p>

 <p>The scoping literature review, in a condensed form relevant for a literature review paper, was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and precisely according to the extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) as suggested by (Tricco et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0057" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). A checklist for the specific scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) is provided as supplementary material in <a href="#app0002">Appendix B</a> (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0013">Table B1</button>). The present scoping review has no published protocol.</p>
 <div id="s0003-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i9">3.1. Information sources and search methods</h3>
  <p>An organized literature search for scientific articles that satisfy specific criteria was performed in Scopus. Scopus<a href="#en0002"><sup>2</sup></a> is the world’s largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature: scientific journals, books, and conference proceedings (Schotten et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). It was selected since it delivers a comprehensive overview of the global research output in science, technology, medicine, social sciences, and arts and humanities.<a href="#en0003"><sup>3</sup></a> Additionally, it features tools to track, analyze and visualize research that helps in a preliminary study of the results.</p>
  <p>A key element for a literature search is the formation of the query. It constitutes an electronic search strategy that can be repeated upon request. The query (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1</a>) includes keywords related to VGI (e.g. vgi*, “volunteered geographic*”, “crowdsourc*”, “geotag*”, “social media”, “blog”, “message”, “SMS”, “Citizen Science”, “social network”, “mobile app*”) and to crisis management (e.g. “disaster management”, “emergency management”, “cris* management”, “humanit*”). Using the wildcard “*“*” permits the retrieval of multiple records with similar wording. Keyword combinations are built using Boolean operators such as “AND“*” and “OR“*”. Keywords are searched in the “Abstract“*”, “Title“*”, or “Keywords“*” fields in the Scopus database.</p>

  <p>For each research paper that satisfied the query, the following fields are extracted from Scopus: “Authors”, “Title”, “Year”, “Source title”, “Volume”, “Issue”, “Cited by”, “DOI”, “Link”, “Affiliations”, “Abstract”, “Author Keywords”, “Index Keywords” and “Document Type”.

 <div id="s0003-s2002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">3.2. Eligibility criteria</h3>
  <p>Several eligibility criteria were applied. The present scoping review aims to study articles from all sources published during 2016–2020 in English regarding the inclusion criteria. Five recent years are selected to give an overview of the latest developments in the usage of VGI avoiding trends that might appear in a single year only. In addition, the English language was chosen to acquire publications from international literature. Various filters in the query restricted the results in these five years of research and language with research outside this period and in other languages to be excluded.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0003-s2003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i12">3.3. Screening – selection of sources of evidence</h3>
  <p>Papers missing critical information such as “Abstract”, “Authors”, and “Affiliations” were excluded. It is essential to exclude false articles or duplications. To accelerate the process, screening automation is proposed to exploit a list of representative keywords. This keyword list is formed from the papers per se to assure objectivity.</p>
  <p>For this reason, Natural Language Processing (NLP) using artificial intelligence was conducted. “Author keywords” extracted from Scopus for all papers were processed in TextRazor,<a href="#en0004"><sup>4</sup></a> an NLP tool. NLP tools are valuable since they aid and streamline the identification of keywords and small phrases consisting of two words, i.e. “disaster management”, that appear more frequently in “Author keywords”. In this framework, NLP tools further assist with identifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria; thus, papers’ classification for qualitative and quantitative meta-analyses is possible. In the second stage, reviewing the abstracts of the articles during the screening led to identifying additional keywords that ensure the inclusion of the maximum number of relevant to the researched subject articles.</p>
  <p>Finally, keywords are classified by the authors (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>) in categories related to and addressing the Scoping Research Questions (SQRs):</p>
  <ul class="NLM_list NLM_list-list_type-bullet" id="list_0001">
   <li><p class="inline">Use: use in crisis, emergency or disaster management (4 keywords), e.g. disaster management</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">VGI sources: sources of VGI (23 keywords), e.g. Twitter</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">Hazard: type of hazard (52 keywords), e.g. flood</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">Task: task in crisis management (53 keywords), e.g. alert</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">Crisis events: specific events with geographic reference at the country level and time (year), e.g. 2017 Hurricane Harvey</p></li>

  <p>The numbers indicate the number of keywords used.</p>
  <p>The screening was applied with a semi-automated process that used queries and extracted information about the papers’ content based on the abovementioned keywords (see <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>) in Excel. In this way, only the papers that meet specific conditions were selected as sources of evidence. For a decision on the articles’ inclusion for further analyses, keywords from the “Use” and “VGI” columns in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button> were searched in the “Author Keywords”, “Index Keywords”, and “Title” fields. The search is applied sequentially. Initially, the “Author Keywords” fields are checked for “Use” keywords; if no keywords exist, then the “Index Keywords” fields are reviewed, and finally, if no keywords exist, then “Title” is checked. The process is repeated for the “VGI” keywords only for eligible papers based on the “Use” keywords. Only papers that satisfy keywords from both categories are further studied. As a result, a subset of the initially proposed papers by Scopus is selected. Finally, “Abstracts” are screened by two reviewers, and papers are excluded accordingly. Moreover, NLP results contributed to identifying the technology and geomatics tools appearing in the research papers. (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0006">Table A2</button> in <a href="#app0001">Appendix A</a>).</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i13">3.4. Synthesis of the results</h3>
  <p>To answer SRQ 2 and SQR 3 (see <a href="#s0003-s2003">section 3.3</a>), additional information was extracted for the eligible records based on keywords for “Hazard” and “Task” (see <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>). Keywords are searched in the “Author Keywords”, ‘Index Keywords”, and “Title” fields sequentially. This step is only a classification phase, and no exclusion is performed.</p>
  <p>In the analysis framework, keywords addressing each SRQ in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button> are further classified (see <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0002">Table 2</button>) for meta-analyses. Keywords for “VGI sources” are classified into four groups, i.e. Big Data/IoT, Crowdsourcing, Map/GIS, Social media, and Special Apps. Keywords for “Hazards” are classified based on the Emergency Events Database<a href="#en0005"><sup>5</sup></a> (EM-DAT)<sup>5</sup> in six groups, i.e. General, Meteorological, Hydrological, Natural Hazard, Human-made, and Disease/Pandemic. Keywords for “Tasks” are classified into four groups related to the disaster management phase, e.g. General (e.g. mapping, information classification, big data computing, information mining, and more), Pre-event, During the event, and Post-event. Further, to investigate the VGI use in world-known crises events, e.g. Hurricane Katrina, the “Abstract” field is searched based on keywords extracted with NLP tools and updated by the authors. The final list of keywords for “Crises Events” can be found in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0011">Table A7</button> in <a href="#app0001">Appendix A</a>. The classification represents the information extracted from the articles’ content; therefore, the keywords are classified accordingly.</p>

  <p>Charting the geographic scope of the included studies is a common practice in scoping review studies (Carrillo et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Dol et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Audate et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Molina-Maturano, Speelman, and De Steur <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0036" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). The geographic distribution of the studies at the region (Audate et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Molina-Maturano, Speelman, and De Steur <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0036" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>) or country level is presented in tabular form (Dol et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) or portrayed on a map (Audate et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).</p>
  <p>This study aims to geolocate the eligible papers at the city level to form a spatial bibliography and visualize the results with interactive maps in a web atlas framework. Research paper geolocation is based on data in “Affiliation” and, more precisely, on the first-mentioned author in case of more than one, which is a common practice for visualizing the spatial distribution of scientific articles (Yan et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0062" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). A detailed list of cities and countries was utilized to identify cities and countries in “Affiliation”. Based on data extracted for City and Country, geographical coordinates were assigned. Each eligible paper is transformed to a spatial point based on the geographical coordinates in the ArcGIS environment, keeping all info, e.g. “Title” and “Abstract”, as non-spatial attributes. This innovation regarding the geolocation of the scoping review results permits the introduction of the <i>spatial scoping review</i> term. Due to the existence of URL addresses in the “DOI” and “Link” fields for each geolocated paper, the data set can be considered Linked Data.<a href="#en0006"><sup>6</sup></a> A constraint of this type of geolocating articles by current first-author affiliation is that cities and countries of the other authors’ affiliations are often not recorded.</p>

   <p>At first, VGI sources are examined (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(a)</a>, <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0007">Table A3</button>). Based on the classification of VGI sources into groups (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0002">Table 2</button>), it is observed (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(b)</a>) that more than three-quarters of VGI is extracted from “Social Media” (76%). The other sources, i.e. “Special (to event/subject) designed apps”, “Big Data/IoT”, and “Map/GIS”, contribute each by 5%, whereas the general term “Crowdsourcing” reaches 10%. A histogram is utilized for a detailed presentation of each VGI source, covering at least 0.5% of cases (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(b)</a>). In this classification, a general reference to “Social Media” and “Social Networking” exhibits a 60%. Specific references to programs/applications include Twitter, Facebook, OSM, Ushahidi, MHealth, EHealth, and E-participation. OSM, Collaborative Mapping, and Participatory GIS, which have a pure geographic character cover of only 2%, suggest that citizens contribute to VGI mainly passively (e.g. social media) and less actively (e.g. OSM). New technologies like IoT and Big Data emerge, and older technology such as SMS exhibit a small percentage.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i22">4.2.2. Hazard</h4>
   <p>Regarding VGI use for managing different hazards, it is evident that VGI is used for various crises (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4(a)</a>, <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0008">Table A4</button>). Based on the classification of hazards into broader categories (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0003">Table 3</button>), the “General” category covers almost 60% of the cases. Percentages of around 10% appear for “Hydrological”, “Natural”, and “Meteorological”, and smaller percentages around 5% for “Disease/Pandemic” and “Human-made” hazards (<a href="#f0005">Figure 5(b)</a>). A detailed presentation with a histogram for each hazard with more than 0.5% of cases can be found in <a href="#f0005">Figure 5(b)</a>. In this graph, general keywords such as “Disaster”, “Crisis”, and “Emergency” that cover 60% were excluded to focus on specific hazards. Most cases refer to “Flood” (10%), but “Hurricane” (8%) and “Earthquake” (7%) are also significant. One should comment on the presence of “COVID-19” in the graph with almost the same cases as “Fire” (2%), although it is present only in two, i.e. 2019 and 2020, of the five years covered by this work. Two human-made hazards appear in this list, “Terrorism” and “Refugee crisis”, whereas two hazards “, COVID-19” and “Disease”, are related to health.</p>

   <p>VGI use in crisis management is observed in different tasks and phases in crisis, emergency, and disaster management (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0002">Table 2</button>). <a href="#f0006">Figure 6(a)</a> and <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0011">Table A7</button> provide evidence for the use of VGI for different tasks and phases of the crisis, emergency and disaster management cycles. Usually, this information is not provided in the articles studied, and “General use” is reported. General descriptions, i.e. “Disaster Management”, “Crisis Management”, and “Emergency management”, exhibit the most significant number of cases (68%). Apart from the “General” group, tasks are classified according to the event (pre, during, post). These groups’ percentage is portrayed in a pie chart (<a href="#f0006">Figure 6(b)</a>). A slight lead is noted for the “Pre-event” and “During the event” use. A detailed presentation with a histogram for each actual use with more than 1% of cases can be found in <a href="#f0006">Figure 6(b)</a>. However, this graph does not depict general descriptors to focus on particular tasks. Most VGI use cases refer to “Crisis communication” (7%), “Awareness” (5%), and “Alarming”, proving the VGI merit in crisis notification.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i28">4.2.5. VGI use in specific crises around the globe</h4>
   <p>An interesting aspect of this research is the verification of the VGI contribution to disaster management by capturing the use in specific real crises, e.g. the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in the USA. For this reason, the “Abstracts” of the eligible papers are screened to find the above information. If such information is not present in the “Abstract” and appears in the full text, it cannot be extracted by this type of screening. About 32% of the papers (310) refer to actual crisis events in specific countries (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0011">Table A7</button>).</p>
   <p>Crises are observed in 81 countries (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0012">Table A8</button>) and nine geographic regions (e.g. Africa, Atlantic Region, Balkans, Europe/European Union, Arab World, Asia, International, and West Africa). Crises distribution at the continent level is portrayed in <a href="#f0008">Figure 8(a)</a>. Crises in Asia (38%) hold the most significant percentage whereas America (30%) and Europe (22%) follow. This observation comes in contrast with the researchers’ distribution at the continent level (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(b)</a>), where Europe exhibits a significant percentage (35%) with Asia (31%) and America (30%) to follow. It contrasts with the continent disaster risk reported in the 2021 World Risk Report.<a href="#en0007"><sup>7</sup></a> Oceania has the highest disaster risk, mainly due to its high exposure to extreme natural events, with Africa, America, Asia, and Europe following in descending order of disaster risk.</p>

   <p>Regarding the spatial distribution of these crises at the country level, a histogram (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(b)</a>) portrays the top 10 countries where these crisis events occur. The USA is the first one with more than 100 mentions. Most of these countries, i.e. China, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines, are situated in Asia, and Australia is in the fourth position. Finally, the three last countries, i.e. Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, are in Europe.</p>
   <p>For several actual crisis events identified from the eligible article’s analysis (165 in number) and have captured the world’s interest, the use of VGI is verified (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0011">Table A7</button>). Crisis events with at least 3% of mentions are depicted in a histogram (<a href="#f0008">Figure 8(a)</a>), with the oldest real crisis event to be recorded and analyzed in 2003 and the most recent in 2020.</p>
   <p>For all crises that appear in the list of “10 Disasters that Changed the World”,<a href="#en0008"><sup>8</sup></a> VGI use is verified by this study, i.e. Haiti Earthquake (2010), Tōhoku Earthquake and Tsunami, Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster (2011), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Typhoon Haiyan (2013), West Africa Ebola Outbreak (2014–2016), Nepal Earthquake (2015), Hurricane Harvey (2017), Hurricane Maria (2017), Cyclone Idai (2019), Global Wildfires (2019). Additionally, some papers are written in the framework of projects that research the use of VGI in disaster management, such as COSMIC, DRIVER, E2mC, EmerGent, ENSURE, I-REACT, Slandail, SOTERIA.</p>

 <h2 id="_i30" class="section-heading-2">5. The interactive VGICED atlas: VGI in crisis, emergency, and disaster management atlas</h2>
 <p>This study suggests the geolocation of eligible studies at the city level by introducing the spatial scoping review method. Geolocated context-specific articles are best explored and visualized through an atlas (Pigeon, Fekete, and Hufschmidt <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) since several maps can present different aspects in a condensed yet detailed form of the analyses of the results. Implementing a web atlas permits disseminating the results to a broader audience, e.g. the scientific community and policymakers. Additionally, its interactive and updatable character, serving the goals of the spatial scoping review, permits quick identification of context-specific and place-based literature and viability, further offering a powerful citation tool. Interactive maps portray environment-specific findings, and data can be queried and investigated based on data stored in the non-spatial attributes (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0004">Table 4</button>). Although modern scientific search engines may provide a citation map (e.g. WOS), the functionality and cartographic excellence provided by the tailor-made web atlas are missing.</p>

 <h2 id="_i40" class="section-heading-2">6. Discussion, conclusions and future plans</h2>
 <p>Spatial analysis, visualization and dissemination provided by the coupling of VGI, handling technologies, and methods for geographic information systems, and remote sensing are valuable for filling potential information and gaps of sources for crisis management globally. This paper aims to explore the use of VGI in crisis management, including emergency and disaster management, based on a scoping review of existing literature in English for five years (2016–2020). The research intends to answer four Scoping Review Questions (SRQ). The visualization of the spatial scoping review results follows an atlas framework based on spatial bibliographical approaches. A web atlas is created, enabling easy access to the research results with maps and data exploration with queries and visualization.</p>
 <p>The authors’ Scoping Review Questions (SRQs) are successfully answered. Regarding SRQ1, VGI use in crisis, emergency, or disaster management is verified. “Humanitarian Aid/Mapping” has a small percentage of less than 1%, indicating that VGI is not utilized substantially for humanitarian aid even though it has proven valuable for prioritizing resource allocation. Concerning the geographical context of VGI use, the international distribution of scientific interest is verified. Asia appears as engaged as America and Europe; an observation that contrasts the results of a generalized multidirectional literature review (Yan et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0062" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>) revealed that from 2007 to 2017, most research was conducted in Europe and America. Although Oceania has a higher world disaster risk, it lags behind other areas in VGI use. Almost identical percentages of 30% for those three continents argue that the inclusion of articles only in the English language has not spoiled the international aim of this research. The international character of VGI involvement in crisis, emergency, or disaster management is also visualized in the VGICED Atlas maps.</p>
 <p>Additionally, it is revealed that developing countries (as globally observed and cited in the literature as the “Global South”) lack the scientific attention that should be given due to high climate-related risks that they phase and are expected to phase in the future with an increasing amount of impacts. Precisely, the World Risk Index of 2021 (WRI2021<a href="#en0010"><sup>10</sup></a>) and the Global Climate Risk Index (GCRI<a href="#en0011"><sup>11</sup></a>) place the Global South in the highest risk areas, with a) the most vulnerable population, b) the highest risk for hazard-related impacts on a societal and infrastructural level and c) the highest risk from climate- and extreme weather-induced impacts. Further, as mentioned in the WRI2021, countries with low economic capacities and income tend to be more vulnerable. Thus, insufficient capability to prevent disasters and extreme weather events often reduces existing capacities. VGI is proven valuable for the timely provision of crucial information before, during, and after a crisis, emergency or disaster. Therefore, it is suggested that funding should be directed toward countries of high vulnerability. Since there is a global consensus that climate adaptation measures need acceleration through financing actions helping developing countries, we suggest that part of the funding should be streamed toward VGI-related projects (e.g. update or expansion of telecommunication infrastructure, technology update of research institutes, and higher education organizations).</p>
 <p>Further, answering the SRQ2 addressing VGI sources, the majority is collected through “Social media” (76%). Only a small percentage has a pure geographic character from VGI that has been contributed actively, e.g. OSM. In contrast, passive collection through social media, i.e. Twitter, is predominant. Citizens should be encouraged to actively participate in the VGI collection with initiatives such as YouthMappers (<a class="ext-link" href="https://www.youthmappers.org/" target="_blank">https://www.youthmappers.org/</a>) and Humanitarian OSM (<a class="ext-link" href="https://www.hotosm.org/" target="_blank">https://www.hotosm.org/</a>). In the HOT framework, volunteers can join Open Mapping Hubs for Eastern and Southern Africa and West and Northern Africa to help developing countries lag behind other geographical areas in VGI use in crisis management. Incentives such as those applied in Geo-Wiki, e.g. coauthor on a scientific paper, an Amazon gift voucher (Laso et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), and gamification can encourage citizens to participate actively in VGI collection (Antoniou and Christoph <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Based on the analysis of active social media users as a percentage of the total population for 2022, percentages for Europe, Asia, and America range from 70 to 85%, but it falls to 27% for Africa.<a href="#en0012"><sup>12</sup></a> This small percentage of social media users is related to the low usage of VGI for crisis, emergency and disaster management in Africa since social media is the primary source. For citizens in developing countries where smartphones are a luxury, simple applications for VGI collection in SMS format may be more appropriate. However, in Oceania, where 84% of the total population uses social media, the VGI usage is too few.</p>
 <p>According to the analysis, new technologies like IoT and Big Data emerge as VGI sources, and older technology such as SMS back away. Specifically, one of the meta-analyses (see <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0006">Table A2</button> in <a href="#app0001">Appendix A</a>) regarding the technologies used for VGI extraction and handling shows that big data computing methods and technologies, including high-performance computing, machine learning, deep learning, and multi-source data fusion, have increasingly become critical components of using social sensing to understand the impact of and response to disaster events promptly (Howell et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Li, Huang, and Christopher <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). More specifically, the analysis conducted in this paper shows an increasing interest from 2016 to 2020, and for deep learning, the research interest is observed to be more recent for 2019 and 2020. This growing interest in deep learning methodologies and technologies is expected to be higher since such techniques have started to be supported through software that provides deep learning tools (e.g. ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Orfeo Toolbox, TensorFlow). Deep learning combined with remote sensing and VGI seems promising for mapping and mining information purposes of underrepresented areas in developing countries where VGI creation and dissemination infrastructure is scarce. Such data handling processes can be valuable, for example, for settlement change identification, real-time forecasting, and timely humanitarian aid, which are globally recognized as practical methods for enhancing and strengthening the preparedness for response and recovery (mitigation phase).</p>
 <p>Further, machine learning methodologies can accelerate the classification of VGI and big data handling, providing the opportunity for prompt topic identification, fake news identification, mining of geolocated information regarding the progress of extreme weather-related impacts, and decreasing mapping inequality gap observed globally, despite the advances of mapping. IoT collects data related to crisis, emergency, and disaster management are considered big data due to volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. The Cloud is the only appropriate environment for processing, storing, and visualizing these data.</p>
 <p>Concerning the SRQ3, the analysis showed that it is evident that VGI is exploited in the management of a variety of hazards, with the “General” category capturing the majority and smaller percentages for “Hydrological”, “Natural”, and “Meteorological”. Regarding the specific type of hazards, “Flood”, “Hurricane”, and “Earthquake” are dominant. One should comment on “COVID-19” (2%), although it is present only in two, i.e. 2019 and 2020, of the five years covered by this work due to its new existence. The results have also shown that 69% of the research is not “phase-related”. This relatively high percentage can be an indication that VGI exploitation in various phases of an event is rather complex to a) retrieve due to lack of technologies, b) identify, c) cleaned – providing phase-related information, d) classify, as was also a complex process for the scoping review conducted in this paper.</p>
 <p>Finally, for the SRQ4, VGI use in actual crisis events (165) with international influence in 81 countries, specifically for the 10 Disasters that changed the world (Meyers <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), is documented. This argues for the VGI verified contribution to disaster management. Certified VGI use in disaster management for world-known crises can be exploited to recruit volunteers worldwide and persuade those who question the VGI value.</p>
 <p>The presented research has several strengths and presents several innovations:</p>
 <ul class="NLM_list NLM_list-list_type-bullet" id="list_0003">
  <li><p class="inline">The Scoping method for literature review is combined with a Spatial Bibliography, and a new method called Spatial Scoping Review is proposed and tested.</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">Conducting a Spatial Scoping Review on VGI use in crisis, emergency and disaster for five years (2016-2020), including 969 eligible articles, created the larger dataset existing so far, covering a comprehensive perspective of this article’s subject.</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">Compared to existing reviews, this paper argues that using only abbreviated terms, as used in ten-year (multi-year) reviews, is already a significant limitation for the literature search and creates high biases in the research outcomes regarding the spatial distribution of scientific interest. For example, the generalized multidirectional literature review conducted by (Yan et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0062" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>) used only the abbreviated term of the volunteered geographic information, i.e. VGI, limiting its search to articles using only the abbreviation and excluding valuable information from the review process.</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">The methodological approach suggested in the article is enriched with NLP tools. Artificial intelligence provided by available NLP tools is proven valuable for analysis purposes such as keyword extraction, which further assists classification and drawing of results. Specifically for a scoping review or even a systematic review, NLP tools allow for additional identification of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and papers’ classification for qualitative and quantitative meta-analyses purposes. Further, NLP tools are valuable since they aid and streamline the identification of keywords and small phrases (i.e. the pairing of keywords), and therefore, it is recommended that they are included in literature reviews for a comprehensive collection of relevant records. Of course, a final check by a researcher is indispensable for assure consistency.</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">The eligibility process of the methodology presented does not exclude many articles; instead, it includes relevant to the subject records providing a comprehensive and relevant subject database. Taxonomies of keywords shown in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button> and sub-grouped as in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0002">Table 2</button> constitute synoptic documentation of current research in VGI use for crisis, emergency and disaster management based on the SRQs. They can be used to screen papers from other search engines, e.g. Web of Science, or published after the period covered. In addition, by comparing taxonomies extracted by articles in the coming years, research innovations can be spotted, and research directions can be proposed.</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">The creation of an interactive web atlas as a viable and updatable visualization and dissemination tool enables further information mining for disaster, crisis, and emergency-related purposes.</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">The ability to publish and visualize research results on the web makes them available to a broader crowd, policymakers, and the scientific community.</p></li>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Several limitations of the present research are also present, such as the following:</p>
 <ul class="NLM_list NLM_list-list_type-bullet" id="list_0004">
  <li><p class="inline">The exclusive use of the Scopus database</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">Extracted results and process success of a literature review depend on the choice of authors’ keywords. If the authors of the research articles investigated have not utilized one of the three main keywords, “crisis”, “emergency”, and “disasters”, in the title, author keywords, index keywords, and abstract, then the articles are excluded from the selection process. For example, authors have utilized hazard-related keywords, e.g. floods. In such hazard-related articles, the authors mainly use the broad term “flood management”, and the keyword pairing “disaster management” was omitted</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">Based on SCOPUS data, it is observed that journals or conferences accept and publish articles that miss crucial information, such as abstract and formal affiliation. By formal affiliation, the full name of the education or research institute that conducts the published research and a complete address is meant. Such missing or incomplete information must be a priority before publication. In this way, the quality of research can be further validated, and further research and collaborations on the subjects published can be promoted</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">Even though this research investigated VGI use in crisis, emergency and disaster management based on publications from the academic field in the framework of a literature review, the VGI use may be wider as cases from the public and private sectors are not usually captured in scientific publications</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">Developing a spatial bibliography can be time-consuming due to the lack of location documentation for affiliations in the publication process or the lack of information on geolocated case studies. Moreover, research on geolocation was solely based on the first author resulting in a biased result where international collaboration is not captured. Thus, the geolocated cities are not guaranteed to reflect where the reported research was conducted (Bornmann et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). For this reason, in this article we also present statistical analyses on smaller geographical scales too (i.e., country and continent level).</p></li>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>Therefore, the methodology can be enriched with searches in abstract and text for case-study geolocation. Additionally, this research methodology can be further expanded in the future by including additional research databases such as the Web of Science. Additionally, it can be extended in time, e.g. the remaining of 2021, and periodically updated at the end of each year to stay temporarily up to date. The geolocation of eligible papers should be multiple: based on all affiliations of the first author and the location of the study area. This will also enhance the number of possible visualizations, information mining, and classification.</p>
 <p>Additionally, to reduce the need to rely heavily on complicated search methods and article parsing to continually find new research, a collection, and dissemination of the results in an interactive Web Atlas can be paired with an existing database managed by a library. Article parsing, as outlined by (Karl <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), can play an important role in automating the identification of coordinates from newly published works to update a spatial bibliography (Howell et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i42 _i43 _i44" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Generally, the proposed method can be adopted for literature reviews in other sectors. Combining a Spatial Scoping Review with a Web Atlas constitutes a valuable research tool for data mining, knowledge extraction, and quick dissemination for the crowd, the scientists, and policymakers.</p>
