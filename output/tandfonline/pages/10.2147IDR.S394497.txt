 <p>Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans by direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their products, for example, through ingestion of raw milk or other unpasteurised milk products.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001 cit0002 cit0003" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1–3</a></span></sup> Other common routes of infection in humans include local cuts and abrasions, infection via the conjunctival sac of the eye, or inhalation of aerosols.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>4</a></span></sup> Brucellosis is caused by pathogenic bacteria of the genus <i>Brucella</i>, classically described as six species, four of which are recognised as zoonotic: <i>Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella canis</i> and <i>Brucella suis</i>. Most cases of brucellosis are associated with B. melitensis, which is due to the presence of many virulence-associated factors.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>5</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span></sup> In humans infected with this Gram-negative bacterium, the disease may cause a wide range of symptoms in the nervous system, musculoskeletal system and heart, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to systemic manifestations with severe complications. The clinical signs and symptoms of brucellosis are not clearly specific and the diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical manifestations such as fever, epidemiological and serological findings.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span></sup> The use of anterior chamber water to detect Brucella antibodies was used earlier, but there may be cases where the anterior chamber water dose is not sufficient for detection.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> These can be combined with ocular symptoms, which may include ocular uveitis, optic papilloedema and keratitis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> In this study, we reviewed patients with <i>Brucella</i> infection presenting with ocular symptoms, to investigate the pathogenesis of <i>Brucella</i> spp. and the possible mechanisms of action relating to ocular infection. This review is also intended to serve as a reference for the management of ocular lesions occurring with <i>Brucella</i> infection.</p>

<div id="s0002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_1">
 <h2 id="_i4" class="section-heading-2">Literature Review</h2>
 <p>We searched PubMed for articles related to <i>Brucella</i> infection-caused ocular lesions. The search formula used was: (((((((((((papilledema) OR (keratitis)) OR (neuritis)) OR (uveitis)) OR (optic neuritis)) OR (Endophthalmitis)) OR (eye)) OR (ocular)) OR (ophthal*)) OR (eyeball)) OR (optic nerve)) AND (brucell*). We included only reports from 1950–2022, excluding those not written in English. Patients were included in the review if <i>Brucella</i> infection was found at the time of diagnosis in combination with ocular symptoms. The following data were collected: age, sex, site of ocular <i>Brucella</i> infection, systemic infection, treatment modality and treatment outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="s0003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_1">
 <h2 id="_i5" class="section-heading-2">Results and Discussion</h2>
 <p>The initial search returned 286 records, and a total of 87 articles met our inclusion criteria after screening by title, abstract and article content. We thereby identified 47 patients with ocular lesions associated with <i>Brucella</i> infection (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>). The average age of the patients at the time of presentation was 27.9 years. There were 28 cases of ocular neuropathy, 15 cases of uveitis, and four cases of other ocular lesions.</p>

 <p><i>B. melitensis</i> is a Gram-negative bacillus and an intracellular bacterium that accounts for approximately 70% of <i>Brucella</i> infections.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0057" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>57</a></span></sup> The most common symptoms of <i>B. melitensis</i> infection in adults are arthralgia, fever, malaise, sweating, lethargy, myalgia and tremor.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>58</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0059" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>59</a></span></sup> The most frequent ocular complications associated with brucellosis are optic neuropathy, uveitis, cataracts, vitreous lesions, ocular atrophy, macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal neovascularisation and retinal detachment by retraction.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0060" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>60</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0061" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>61</a></span></sup> Other, less frequent, complications include dacryocystitis and lacrimal ductitis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0062" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>62</a></span></sup> Ocular uveitis caused by <i>Brucella</i> infection most often manifests as posterior uveitis, followed by total uveitis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>44</a></span></sup> In this review, by exploring the relevant literature, we will describe the infectious process and consider possible mechanisms associated with ocular pathogenesis in brucellosis.</p>
 <p>From the risk factors of the patients included in this study, the majority of patients had a clear history of exposure, such as consumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese products, a history of working in animal husbandry and a history of travel to areas with developed animal husbandry, and only a few patients had no clear history of exposure, but the patients themselves lived in infected areas. Brucella infection is associated with exposure to diseased animals and consumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and veterinarians, laboratory workers, slaughterhouse workers and farmers are at higher risk of developing the disease compared to the normal population.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0063" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>63</a></span></sup> Therefore, the patient’s past history is also an important reference for the diagnosis of Brucella infection.</p>
 <p><i>Brucella</i> infection generally occurs through either direct contact with infected animals, or contact with the secretions of infected animals. Although some studies have shown that <i>Brucella</i> can invade the respiratory tract and the oral, conjunctival, lacrimal, vaginal and foreskin mucosa, the exact mechanism of epithelial cell invasion in these tissues is currently unknown.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0064" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>64</a></span></sup> <i>Brucella</i> infection can be divided into three stages. First, the pathogen invades the host within two days of infection. In the second stage, known as the acute phase of the infection, the pathogen replicates in the reticuloendothelium and in different organs of the reproductive system, usually between two days to three weeks post-infection. In the third stage, known as the chronic phase, the pathology varies in different tissues and can last from six months to one year or more.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0065" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>65</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0066" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>66</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>The main pathogenic mechanism of <i>B. melitensis</i> is invasion of host cells, which relies on a variety of virulence factors released by the bacterium, enabling the pathogen to evade clearance by the host’s immune defences. Thus, <i>B. melitensis</i> can survive, replicate and proliferate inside host cells, then enter organs and tissues through macrophages to form foci of infection, or migratory foci.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0067" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>67</a></span></sup> For example, <i>B. abortus</i> is naturally resistant to killing by neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0068" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>68</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0069" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>69</a></span></sup> When brucellae enter the body, these are the major phagocytic cell types that engulf and internalise the invading bacteria, and together, they constitute the primary host cells for <i>Brucella</i> replication.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0070" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>70</a></span></sup> Internalisation results in intracellular <i>Brucella</i>-containing vesicles that interact with components of the endocytic and secretory pathways, such as early endosomes and vacuoles, which intersect with bacterial replication inside the endoplasmic reticulum. In this process, the bacteria avoid fusion with lysosomes, not only prolonging the survival of macrophages but also promoting dendritic cell maturation.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0071" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>71</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0072" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>72</a></span></sup> <i>Brucella</i> ends its intracellular cycle by recruiting components of the autophagic apparatus to the vacuole, to complete the replication process via bacterial egress and enable infection of neutrophils and other cells.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0073" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>73</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0074" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>74</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Once <i>Brucella</i> enters neutrophils, it survives in the phagosome and persists for a period of time, resisting the bactericidal activity of these leukocytes.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0075" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>75</a></span></sup> After infecting immune cells, the pathogen will next move to the regional lymph nodes, but the infected host will not yet show signs of disease.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0076" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>76</a></span></sup> Finally, <i>Brucella</i> spreads through the systemic lymphatic circulation to different organs of the reticuloendothelial system, including the lungs, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and even the eyes.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0077" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>77</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>In summary, pathogenic brucellae enter host cells, exert self-protective mechanisms to avoid being broken down by lysosomes, and then enter the next phase to infect the target organs after replication is completed. The host’s immune system cannot effectively eliminate the pathogen and block the infection process (<a href="#f0001">Figure 1</a>). <i>Brucella</i> infections exhibit a range of non-characteristic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache and neurological deficits, making them difficult to diagnose. However, if diagnosis or therapeutic intervention is not properly managed, the bacteria may invade and replicate inside vital organs—such as the bone marrow, heart and brain—leading to severe systemic reactions, and perhaps even the death of the patient.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0078" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>78</a></span></sup> Therefore, early and definitive diagnosis of brucellosis, along with targeted pharmacological treatment, is of considerable clinical significance and can reduce the occurrence of serious complications in affected patients.</p>

  <p>The incidence of neurobrucellosis in <i>Brucella</i> infection is 0.5–25%, and its clinical manifestations include meningitis, meningeal vascular involvement, parenchymal brain dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioural abnormalities of varying severity.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0079" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>79</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0080" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>80</a></span></sup> Previous studies on <i>Brucella</i> brain infections have shown that pathogenic bacteria reaching the reticuloendothelial system can enter the circulation and spread to the meninges, causing meningitis or meningoencephalitis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0081" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>81</a></span></sup> The toxins released cause endothelial damage leading to arteritis and cerebral ischemia, and which can also result in vascular occlusion causing cerebral infarction.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span></sup></p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i8">Pathogenesis and Clinical Manifestations of Neurobrucellosis</h4>
   <p><i>Brucella</i> can provoke an inflammatory response at the site of the lesion by direct action, but also by secreting cytokines and endotoxins that affect the structure and function of the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, meninges or blood vessels.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0082" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>82</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0083" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>83</a></span></sup> Thus, the pathogenesis of <i>Brucella</i> infection leading to neuropathy is thought to be mediated by the action of cytokines or bacterial endotoxins on neuronal tissue, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and immune mechanisms that cause demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord white matter.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0084" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>84</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0085" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>85</a></span></sup> The above mechanisms of injury may lead to perivascular infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages. In turn, cellular infiltration can contribute to intimal oedema and proliferative neuropathy, resulting in segmental demyelination, remyelination, axonal degeneration and proliferative neuropathy.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>35</a></span></sup> <i>Brucella</i> infection causes an immune-mediated response in the central nervous system, resulting in vasculopathy not only associated with cranial neuropathy, but also closely related to optic nerve-related diseases.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>14</a></span></sup></p>
   <p>Thus, <i>Brucella</i> can cause damage not only to the brain and peripheral nervous system, but also to the optic nerve, usually manifesting as optic nerve oedema.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>13</a></span></sup> Optic neuritis, abducens nerve palsy and other cranial nerve involvement may therefore be part of the neuropathy of brucellosis. Cranial nerve involvement in brucellosis mainly includes the trigeminal, facial, abducens, actinic or optic nerves. Neurobrucellosis can involve any one of these nerves, either alone or in combination.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>29</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0086" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>86</a></span></sup> Optic disc oedema may occur due to axoplasmic congestion of unmyelinated axons of the optic nerve papillae, secondary to inflammation associated with demyelination behind the optic nerve bulb. In terms of ocular neuropathies, the most susceptible ocular nerves are the optic and abducens nerves.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0087" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>87</a></span></sup> Thus, brucellosis complications can include optic neuritis and abducens nerve palsy/paralysis, but the mechanisms are not understood.</p>
   <p>In the event of optic nerve oedema due to <i>Brucella</i> infection, one of the possible pathogeneses is vasculitis, a characteristic manifestation of brucellosis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23</a></span></sup> The prognosis for patients with optic nerve papilloedema secondary to vasculitis is relatively poor, and most will eventually develop optic nerve atrophy.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup> In addition to optic nerve injury due to vasculitis, increased intracranial pressure due to <i>Brucella</i> infection can also lead to optic nerve papillary oedema and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. This generally has less effect on visual acuity and pupillary reflexes, unlike optic neuritis due to vasculitis, which exhibits relatively more afferent pupillary disturbance and significant vision loss.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0088" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>88</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0089" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>89</a></span></sup> Thus, unlike optic nerve oedema due to vasculitis, patients with optic papilloedema due to increased intracranial pressure can be more effectively treated.</p>
   <p>One previous report concerned a 14-year-old female patient presenting with increased intracranial pressure and strabismus, with bilateral abducens nerve involvement and bilateral papilloedema, who had normalised vision and reduced papilloedema when followed up after six months of treatment.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0090" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>90</a></span></sup> Akhondian showed that increased intracranial pressure in an 11-year-old child, accompanied by optic papilloedema and blurred vision, was due to brucellosis and that visual acuity recovered and optic papilloedema subsided after one month of treatment.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>20</a></span></sup> Therefore, the treatment outcomes for optic neuritis and optic nerve oedema caused by <i>Brucella</i> infection differ considerably, and the presence of combined vascular inflammation may be an important indicator when evaluating visual prognosis.</p>
   <p>As well as vision loss due to optic nerve oedema, another important neurological symptom of <i>Brucella</i> infection of the eye is ocular abducens nerve palsy. The abducens nerve is one of the cranial nerves, and cranial nerve palsy may be due to endotoxin-induced spasm involving the central auditory pathway, or ischemia of the nerve tissue. The abducens nerve (also known as the sixth cranial nerve, or cranial nerve VI) has the longest intracranial course and is susceptible to direct or indirect injury, for example, through microvascular infarction or direct compression.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0091" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>91</a></span></sup> Furthermore, abducens nerve palsy may have a similar pathogenesis to optic neuritis—including intracranial meningeal inflammation leading to meningeal infection—given the fact that <i>Brucella</i> can attack Schwann cells after reaching the neuraxis via the circulatory system or lymphatic system, leading to demyelination.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0092" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>92</a></span></sup> Since the abducens and optic nerves are among the cranial nerves, the mechanism of occurrence may be similar to that of optic neuritis, and we believe that vascular inflammation may also be involved in the pathology of abducens nerve palsy.</p>
   <p>Although any meningitis can cause abducens nerve palsy through direct inflammation, increased intracranial pressure, or both, one study found that brucellosis patients can develop abducens nerve palsy before the onset of meningitis symptoms. This suggests that cranial nerve involvement and symptom onset may precede meningeal infection.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>17</a></span></sup> Furthermore, abducens nerve palsy can also occur during neurobrucellosis drug treatment.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0093" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>93</a></span></sup> Sahin et al additionally showed that <i>Brucella</i> infection may negatively affect multiple cranial nerves, including the optic, vestibulocochlear and abducens nerves.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup> Therefore, patients with acute abducens nerve palsy should undergo a thorough neurological and medical evaluation. Myasthenia gravis, paraneoplastic diseases, trauma, and tumours should be prioritised; and syphilis, nodal disease, and Lyme disease may be rare etiologies.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0094" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>94</a></span></sup> Neuroimaging and CSF analysis are recommended when other neurological symptoms are present. When the diagnosis is unclear, the possibility of <i>Brucella</i> infection must be considered in patients from endemic areas and with a history of possible exposure.</p>
   <p>In summary, the possible pathogeneses of ocular neuropathy caused by <i>Brucella</i> may be briefly explained as follows.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>32</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>35</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0060" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>60</a></span></sup></p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i9">Detection Method of Neurobrucellosis</h4>
   <p>Brucella detection relies mainly on biochemical tests, including microbiological culture, serological tests (Coombs test, immunocapture agglutination, Brucellacapt, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect fluorescent antibody test) and molecular tests (real-time PCR).<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0095" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>95</a></span></sup> Neurobrucellosis is difficult to diagnose definitively in clinical care, because it is based on positive CSF bacterial cultures or elevated titres of any <i>Brucella</i> antibodies, and abnormal CSF measurements: CSF cell count &gt;10<sup>6</sup>/L, decreased glucose and increased protein.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0096" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>96</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0097" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>97</a></span></sup> In addition, In the detection of <i>Brucella</i> abortus, the accounting amplification test assay is also one of the commonly used methods. These include conventional PCR methods, in-house PCR, nested PCR, PCR enzyme immunoassay in microplate format, real-time PCR, quantitative RT-PCR and multiplex real-time PCR.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0098 cit0099 cit0100 cit0101" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>98–101</a></span></sup> Recently, a new method based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification was used for <i>Brucella</i> detection.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0102" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>102</a></span></sup> Besides, although in vitro bacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosis of neurobrucellosis, the culture positivity rate is quite low (&lt;15%) and can easily result in false-negative results in clinical management.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0103" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>103</a></span></sup> Moreover, brucellae take a long time to culture, and this may delay patient treatment while waiting for the results. Particularly in countries where <i>Brucella</i> infection is endemic, diagnosis therefore needs to be based on screening for a history of ingestion of unpasteurised cow’s or goat’s milk, or other dairy products, or exposure to raw lamb, excluding other clinically important etiologies.</p>
   <p>In neurobrucellosis, detection of <i>Brucella</i> requires screening for the bacterium in blood, bone marrow or CSF. Serum and CSF titres above 1:160 and 1:80, respectively, and CSF abnormalities manifesting as increased protein and lymphocytosis, strengthen the sensitivity of laboratory diagnosis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>26</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0104" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>104</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0105" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>105</a></span></sup> At present, neurobrucellosis has neither a typical clinical presentation nor a specific CSF presentation by which to make a clear clinical diagnosis,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0106" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>106</a></span></sup> and treatment with doxycycline prior to lumbar puncture may also result in a negative CSF culture.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>10</a></span></sup> Therefore, the timing of the test is crucial for diagnosis.

   <p>In areas of brucellosis outbreaks, greater caution is needed in the treatment of optic neuritis, requiring associated imaging and exclusion of those with clinical suspicion of neuromyelitis optica.

   <p>In neurobrucellosis, intracranial hypertension secondary to optic nerve atrophy rarely leads to persistent vision loss, although it has been reported in more than 50% of cases. With appropriate antibiotic treatment, however, there is usually complete regression without loss of vision.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0110" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>110</a></span></sup> If patients are not diagnosed and treated promptly, optic nerve atrophy secondary to optic nerve papilloedema can lead to severe visual impairment that cannot be recovered, and permanent vision loss.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>28</a></span></sup> This may be related to blockage of the fast and slow phase of axial blood flow associated with optic nerve papilloedema, which in turn leads to impairment of normal physiological activity of the nerve, inducing optic atrophy.

As for the duration of treatment, <i>Brucella</i> infections are difficult to clear and generally require at least two or three months of regular medication to achieve a therapeutic effect.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>42</a></span></sup> Early discontinuation of treatment may lead to disease recurrence and the development of drug-resistant bacteria. It is therefore crucial to appreciate the importance of initiating medication after a clear diagnosis. Furthermore, as with all infectious uveitis, direct treatment with immunosuppressive agents due to initial misdiagnosis may lead to a worsening of the patient’s condition, in which case an extended period of treatment may be necessary.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0041" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>41</a></span></sup> Therefore, immunosuppressive agents should be used with caution when the aetiology of uveitis is not clear.</p>

 <h2 id="_i15" class="section-heading-2">Other Ocular Lesions in <i>Brucella</i> Infection</h2>
 <p>As well as causing optic nerve-related diseases and uveitis, <i>Brucella</i> infections can also affect the ocular appendages. Lacrimal ductitis can occur, perhaps through direct invasion of the ocular structures, suggesting that <i>Brucella</i> species are capable of colonising the epidermis directly.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>54</a></span></sup> Nevertheless, the condition manifests as damage to the lacrimal duct and lacrimal gland tissue. Patients present with excessive protrusion of the eye, increased lacrimal secretions and unilateral lacrimal gland inflammation. Association with brucellosis is confirmed by serology, lacrimal gland secretion culture and histopathology.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>56</a></span></sup> Systemic infections can cause mastitis and pancreatitis, and infection of these secretory glands may have the same pathogenesis as lacrimal gland infections, lending support to the idea that <i>Brucella</i> affects the exocrine glands.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0049" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>49</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0134" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>134</a></span></sup> Subcutaneous abscesses caused by brucellae are relatively rare, but can be associated with the development of conjunctivitis and lacrimal gland infections, which are soft tissue infections usually associated with penetrating injuries.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0135" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>135</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0136" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>136</a></span></sup> The <i>Brucella</i> vaccine bottle was accidentally dropped and some of its contents entered the veterinarian’s conjunctival sac, resulting in the development of bilateral keratoconjunctivitis. After two months of infection, the <i>Brucella</i> titer reached 1/320. The treatment was not effective and eventually the patient’s uncontrolled infection caused total ophthalmia resulting in eye removal.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0137" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>137</a></span></sup> Therefore, localized infection caused by <i>Brucella</i> can also lead to uncontrolled infection and blindness, which needs to be taken into account by physicians and patients in clinical practice.</p>
 <p>In our opinion, it is possible that lacrimal gland infections and conjunctivitis caused by <i>Brucella</i> are direct infections caused by patient exposure to these bacteria in the eye. Another plausible explanation is that <i>Brucella</i> accesses the lesion site from the lymph nodes, bone and blood circulation. Because there is no history of penetrating injury or other clinically relevant manifestations in the vast majority of patients, and because abscesses at different sites may be the result of bacterial infections, serologic data from patients may also suggest chronic limited brucellosis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0036" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>36</a></span></sup> Further pathological and histological studies are required in the future to reveal the underlying mechanisms of abscess occurrence. <i>Brucella</i> invasion of the lacrimal gland is extremely rare, but the mechanism of glandular injury causing abscess may be similar to endophthalmitis, as involvement of brucellosis-associated lacrimal gland inflammation appears to be a new extraocular infectious reaction.</p>

 <h2 id="_i16" class="section-heading-2">Conclusions</h2>
 <p>In conclusion, we have reviewed the general and ocular pathogenesis of virulent <i>Brucella</i> species (<a href="#f0002">Figure 2</a>). <i>Brucella</i> infection is uncommon in non-endemic regions, and misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis may occur; therefore, ophthalmic clinicians should consider ocular pathology due to brucellosis as part of the diagnostic process. In patients with a known history of epidemiological risk or contact, brucellosis should certainly be included as a possible cause of optic neuritis, abducens nerve palsy, uveitis and lacrimal sacculitis. In such cases, systemic and intraocular fluid testing will be an important adjunct to other diagnostic procedures. Prevention strategies include, among others, avoidance of unpasteurised dairy products (milk or cheese) and animal contact (farm animals, or raw beef and lamb) in endemic areas. Although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding optimal treatment, combination therapy with antibiotics is appropriate, when tolerated, in systemic brucellosis. For ocular lesions associated with <i>Brucella</i> infection, early pharmacological intervention may be an important factor in restoring and protecting the patient’s vision.</p>
