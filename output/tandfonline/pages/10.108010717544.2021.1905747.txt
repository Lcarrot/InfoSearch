 <h2 id="_i4" class="section-heading-2">1. Introduction</h2>
 <p>Bronchial asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract and is one of the major health challenges in the twenty-first century that occurs in all countries regardless of the development level (Sherkawy et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0118" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of patients suffering from asthma is 300 million people worldwide and is expected to increasingly rampant to 400 million, by 2025 (Hussain et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0059" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). It has serious medical, psychological and economic impact and accounts for ∼418,000 deaths a year globally. More seriously, childhood asthma is the leading chronic illness related to school absenteeism and disability (Hsu et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0055" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>).</p>
 <p>Asthma is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, and wheezing (Abdеlaziz et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0002" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). The common asthma triggers can be categorized as either allergic (pollens, dust, mold, and food allergens) or non-allergic including air pollution and irritants like cigarette smoke, respiratory infections, and strong odors (Ioachimescu &amp; Desai, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0062" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). These triggers often aggravates and flare-up asthma leading to increased inflammatory cells infiltration especially eosinophil and interleukins causing muscle contraction and airway constriction (Qutubuddin et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0103" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).</p>
 <p>Currently, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are still the golden treatment that can effectively suppress the characteristic inflammation in asthmatic airways (Barnes, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0013" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). However, despite their beneficial clinical effects, their long-term treatment is associated with a well-known adverse events include possible growth retardation in children, osteoporosis, cataract formation, impaired immune response, and infections in the oropharynx. Such complications motivate developing a novel inhaled glucocorticoid with high local potency and minimal systemic absorption to improve safety profile (Leung et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0075" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). Therefore, ciclesonide (CIC), a new-generation non-halogenated gluco-corticosteroid with high local anti-inflammatory properties and no oral bioavailability was approved in the European Union in 2005–2006 for the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescent (Vogelmeier et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0129" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). CIC is an inactive prodrug and converted to its active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC), in lung tissue by airway specific esterase (Boulet et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0018" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>). Des-CIC has a 100-fold greater relative glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity than CIC which has almost no affinity for this receptor. In addition, des-CIC is lipophilic and readily conjugates to fatty acids at a hydroxyl group at C21 ensuring long-lasting anti-inflammatory effect on the lung and any absorbed portion is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%), leaving &lt;1% of free drug in the systemic circulation, hence potentially minimizing systemic adverse effects (Leung et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0075" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). Although the commercial prevalence of CIC metered dose inhaler (MDI) yet, its clinical efficiency is limited by many errors such as poor coordination of aerosol generation with patient inhalation (Labiris &amp; Dolovich, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0073" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>). Other critical errors include quick breathing, stopping inhalation after firing the MDI and patient failing to hold the breath for further 6–10 s can all reduce lung deposition (Sanchis et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0112" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). The use of ethanol as co-solvent to improve the poor solubility of CIC in hydrofluroalkane (HFA) propellant used in the commercial product is another critical concern. Reduction in the formulation vapors pressure required for automation upon ethanol addition was reported with consequent increase in the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and a decrease in the fine particle fraction (FPF) were inevitably impair the system performance and decrease delivered CIC to the lung (Myrdal et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0089" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Zhu et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0141" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>).</p>
 <p>In addition to the above-mentioned obstacles, patients with severe asthma exacerbation pose special challenges to use MDIs as it requires deep, slow and steady inhalation which is very difficult with severe airway obstruction (Price et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0102" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). Therefore, the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease and for patients with low inspiratory force recommends nebulizers rather than DPIs or MDIs because the aerosol in nebulizers is continuously produced, and the aerosolized particles enter the airways in a repeated, slower, and humidified inspired air; therefore, the central airways are filled with a more uniformly distributed particles (Kamimura et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0067" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>) while the patient is using tidal-volume breathing with minimal coordination and effort during inhalation (Dhand et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0028" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>). Not only but also, larger doses of different compatible drug solutions can be mixed and nebulized together easily. Therefore, nebulizers are preferable for pediatric, elderly, ventilated, and unconscious patients (Ibrahim et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0060" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>).</p>
 <p>Clinically, asthma control still remains deficient owing to the inflammations located in the small airways, the major site of airflow limitation in asthma, and the relative inaccessibility of this lung region by conventional ICS which preferentially deposited in the larger airways even if high doses of ICS are prescribed (Berry et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0016" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). Therefore, the endeavors of targeting small peripheral airways could benefit to a great extent from the nanotechnology for designing CIC nanoparticle of suitable aerodynamic properties for small airways nebulization and better optimum asthma control (Usmani, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0127" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>).</p>
 <p>Nanostructured lipid particles (NLPs), a second generation of solid lipid nanoparticles, is a solid particulate carrier system made of solid outer layer entrapping oil core, therefore, allowing higher payload capacity of lipophilic drugs (Patlolla et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0100" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). Recently, aerosolizable NLPs have attracted much attention for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases owing to their vital potential to overcome intrinsic challenges encountered by the macrophagic lung clearance (Pardeike et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0097" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>).</p>
 <p>Based on literature review, only one report (Fu et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0045" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) has been attempted to provide pulmonary delivery of CIC till current date, but with limited success due to the obtained large MMAD∼6&nbsp;µm of the prepared CIC suspension which promoted the majority of drug deposition in large conducting airways and oropharyngeal region. The higher amount of drug recovered in the gastrointestinal tract due to mucociliary clearance and complete removal of CIC suspension from the airways within 2 h is another miscarriage.</p>
 <p>Thus, the objective of the current study was to explore the feasibility of encapsulating CIC into safe, biodegradable, biocompatible, and bioadhesive NLPs to the airways mucosal surface using more uniform nebulizable mode to elude mucociliary lung transit and provide deep local prolonged CIC therapeutic effect with less dosing frequency and better patient compliance (Pardeike et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0097" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>; Weber et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0130" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). To confirm the efficacy of the developed CIC nano-structure lipid particles (CIC-NLPs), it was tested on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model in Balb/c mice. The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects as well as the histopathological changes were assessed and compared to Alvesco<sup>®</sup>, a commercially available MDI product.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i8">2.2.1. Lipid screening</h4>
   <p>Four oils (capryol 90, labrafac, lauroglycol, and Miglyol812) and four solid lipids (precirol, compritol, glyceryl monostearate, and gelucire 44/14) were screened for maximum CIC solubility in each lipid. The solubility of CIC was estimated by dissolving excess amount of CIC in 2 ml liquid lipid/or adding 2 mg drug increments to the melted solid lipid (5–10 °C above melting temperature of each solid lipid) on a magnetic stirrer (MSH 420, BOECO, Hamburg, Germany) at 120 rpm for 24 h to yield a clear solution. The solubility of CIC in solid lipids was examined visually for the presence or absence of drug crystals. The maximum amount of the drug that remained soluble and beyond which precipitation took place was regarded as the solubility of the drug (Shevalkar &amp; Vavia, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0119" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Solubility in liquid lipid was estimated after separating the undissolved CIC by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, at 25 °C for 20 min and the supernatant was separated and diluted with methanol. The concentration of the dissolved CIC was quantified using 1100 Agilent HPLC system with a UV detector (Agilent VWD G1314A, Santa Clara, CA). Chromatographic separation was made on Phenomenex<sup>®</sup> C18column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 10&nbsp;µm) maintained at ambient temperature. The mobile phase composed of a binary mixture of HPLC grade absolute ethanol and deionized water at a ratio of 70:30 (v/v) filtered through 0.2 μm membrane filter, degassed before use and delivered at flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples of 20 μl were injected and effluents were monitored at 242 nm (Elkady &amp; Fouad, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0034" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). Linear correlation between peak area and CIC concentration was obtained within the concentration range of 10–1000&nbsp;µg/ml (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.998). All measurements were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean values (µg/ml)±SD.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i9">2.2.2. Selection of solid and liquid lipid ratio</h4>
   <p>To test the miscibility between the best CIC solubilizing solid and liquid lipids, different ratios (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 5:5) of lipid mixtures were stirred at 120 rpm for 1 h at 65, 80 °C for precirol and compritol, respectively. The lipid mixture was then cooled to congeal at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). 24 h after solidification, a sample of the lipid mixture was smeared onto filter paper and observed visually for the existence of any oil droplets, which would indicate immiscibility between the solid and the liquid lipids (Mendes et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0085" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). Moreover, in order to obtain information on recrystallization of CIC from the lipid mixture, a drop of the melted drug–lipid mixture was inspected for the presence of drug crystals by light microscopy (Olympus CX31, Tokyo, Japan) (Kovačević et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0071" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>).</p>

   <p>A 2<sup>4</sup> factorial design was applied to study the effect of four critical independent formulation variables on the characteristics of the developed CIC-NLPs. (A) The solid:liquid lipid ratio (7:3, 9:1) and (B) the homogenization speed (10,000 and 20,000 rpm) at two levels (low and high) were screened as numerical variables whereas (C) solid lipid type (compritol and precirol), and (D) liquid lipid type (labrafac and miglyol) were evaluated as categorical factors. Other parameters, such as homogenization time, drug and surfactant concentrations were set at fixed values. A total of 16 runs were attempted using Design-Expert<sup>®</sup> software (version 9, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and particle size (PS) (Y1), polydispersity index (PDI) (Y2), and entrapment efficiency (CIC-EE%) (Y3) as dependent responses were considered the critical attributes of the final target NLPs profile (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>).

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i12">2.2.4. Preparation of CIC-loaded NLPs</h4>
   <p>CIC-NLPs were prepared utilizing hot microemulsion technique (Mendes et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0084" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Briefly, in a clear glass vial, the solid lipid (compritol or precirol at 7 or 9%) was melted 5–10 °C above the melting point of the respective lipid to produce internal imperfection for better accommodation of the liquid lipid (Elmowafy et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0042" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). CIC (0.01%) and lecithin as lipidic surfactant (0.5%w/w) were completely dissolved in liquid lipid (miglyol or labrafac at 1 or 3%) then added to molten solid lipid to form the lipid phase. At the same time, the aqueous surfactant phase of Tween 80 (2%w/w) in deionized water was preheated to the lipid temperature to avoid its recrystallization (Singh et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0122" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) and added drop wise to the lipid phase under thermostatic continuous stirring at 600 rpm (Banerjee et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0011" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) for 30 min. The resultant primary emulsion was further homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax T25 (IKA Labortechnik, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany) applying increasing intensities of 10,000 and 20,000 rpm for 5 min (Severino et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0115" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>). Finally, the produced dispersions were cooled down to room temperature resulting in the formation of NLPs. Each formulation was prepared and characterized in triplicate.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i13">2.2.5. Particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential (ZP)</h4>
   <p>The mean PS, PDI, and ZP of CIC-NLPs were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) technique using Malvern Zetasizer (Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Prior to the measurements, each sample was diluted with de-ionized water (1:100) to avoid multiple scattering of the light caused by a high concentration of particle (Yousry et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0135" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>).

   <p>Both EE and DL are determined indirectly by the separation of un-encapsulated CIC from the NLPs by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant containing the un-encapsulated (free) drug was diluted with the mobile phase and quantified by the aforementioned HPLC method described in Section 2.2.1.

(<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0035" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>) to test release profile of drug particulate intended for pulmonary delivery in limited volume. The Franz diffusion cell with a diffusion area of 1.77 cm<sup>2</sup> was used. The receptor compartment contained 7.5 ml of Gamble’s simulated lung fluid of pH 7.4 to mimic the interstitial fluid deep within the lung (Marques et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0082" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>).

Tween 80 (0.5% v/v) was added to maintain sink condition and the system was equilibrated at 37 ± 0.5 °C by a circulating water jacket. NLPs dispersion containing the equivalent of 40&nbsp;µg CIC was dispersed in 200&nbsp;µl of release media and placed in a dialysis membrane previously soaked overnight in the release medium before use, tightly tied from both ends and then loaded into the receptor compartment which was constantly stirred at 150 rpm with a small magnetic bar. At certain time intervals (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h), 0.5 ml samples were aliquoted from the receptor compartment and replaced with equal volumes of fresh medium to maintain a constant volume. Samples were filtered using 0.22 μm filter and analyzed by HPLC method previously described. All release experiments were done in triplicates and the release data were fitted to various release kinetic models; zero, first, Higuchi diffusion as well as Hixson–Crowell and Korsmeyer–Peppas models (Ritger &amp; Peppas, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0106" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1987</a></span>).</p>

CIC–NLP4 (3 ml) were placed in the nebulizer and aerosolized to dryness directly into the throat of the impactor. At the end of the experiment, the sample deposited into induction port, mouth piece, impactor stages (0–7) and filters were recovered with methanol, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min and quantified by HPLC (Manconi et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0080" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Aerodynamic parameters as MMAD, FPF, and geometric standard deviation (GSD) were automatically calculated from the cumulative mass distribution in the ACI using Copley Inhaler Testing Data Analysis Software (CITDAS; Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK).

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i42">3.1. Lipids screening</h3>
  <p>The development of nebulized CIC-NLPs for the lung is a good alternative for improving the current ethanol based MDI treatment. The efficient CIC pulmonary delivery is considerably challenging by the rapid lung clearance and necessitates careful selection of lipids and surfactant to achieve safe suitable aerodynamically aerosolized nanoparticles for deep local alveoli deposition (Beloqui et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0015" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). All solid and liquid lipids used are biocompatible carriers of excellent safety profile and highly tolerable to the lung (Sanna et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0113" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>; Pastor et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0098" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Patil-Gadhe et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0099" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Zhang et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0139" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Chana et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0020" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Moreno-Sastre et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0086" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Huguet-Casquero et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0058" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). The solid lipids exhibited high melting point above 40 °C to prevent formation of super cooled melts so that the prepared NLPs remain in the solid state at room and body temperature (Mendes et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0085" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). Keeping in mind the lipophilic nature of CIC and its poor water solubility with log <i>p</i> value of 5.3, one can understand the highest CIC payload with maximum solubility in precirol (327.01&nbsp;µg/ml) followed by compritol (293.96&nbsp;µg/ml) as predicted from <a href="#F0002">Figure 2</a>. Although both of them are lipophilic triglycerides of long chain fatty acids (C18 and C22, respectively) with absence of PEG esters and low HLB value of ∼2 (Hamdani et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0051" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>), the superior solubility of precirol stem from the difference in their crystalline properties where, the low tendency of precirol to crystallize into different polymorphic forms host more CIC (Shevalkar &amp; Vavia, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0119" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) in contrast to highly crystalline compritol with perfect lattice (Huang et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0056" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>).</p>

  <p>One of the essential parameters to develop successful pulmonary NLPs of high drug payload is not only the selection of appropriate liquid lipid to form CIC enriched core and shell for prolonged pulmonary delivery but also the type of oil used can influence the pulmonary function. The addition of oil to the solid lipid, produces imperfections to the solid lattice structure thus, separating the chains of the fatty acids leaving more voids for CIC accommodation (Mubarak &amp; Mohamed, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Aside from long chain triglycerides (LCTs) oils that have been proven as crucial mediators of chronic airway inflammation with potential proinflammatory properties, that lead to impairment in pulmonary function (Sabater et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0107" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). Only medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) are used for CIC screening in this study. In particular, MCT of acrylic (C8:0)/caprice (C10:0) acids of better fluidity, higher solubilization capacity (Aburahma et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0003" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) and absence of double bonds that catalyze oxidation and elevate anti-inflammatory activation markers significantly (Yu et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0136" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). It was depicted from <a href="#F0002">Figure 2</a> that labrafac and miglyol 812 provide greatest solubility for lipophilic CIC (855.09 ± 16.52 and 681.86 ± 15.69&nbsp;µg/ml, respectively) than more hydrophilic propylene glycol ester based MCTs capryol and lauroglycol (435.48 ± 12.51 and 396.81 ± 18.11&nbsp;µg/ml, respectively). Therefore, both (precirol and compritol) as well as (labrafac and miglyol 812) were selected and tested as solid–liquid lipid matrix for CIC-NLPs preparation.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i44">3.2. Compatibility between binary lipid mixture</h3>
  <p>Among different tested solid–liquid lipid ratios (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 5:5), only the ratios containing higher solid lipid content (9:1, 8:2, and 7:3) demonstrated excellent lipid miscibility with neither detected oil droplets on the filter paper nor drug recrystallization observed visually and under light microscope. Consequently, the effects of higher and lower oil concentrations (7:3 and 9:1) were only processed further for optimization of CIC-NLPs formation.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i45">3.3. Preparation of CIC-NLPs</h3>
  <p>CIC-NLPs were prepared using inexpensive, easy scale-up, low-energy, hot microemulsion approach in which water-insoluble CIC was solubilized in the dispersed oil phase of the microemulsion, to obtain high CIC entrapment in the cured NLPs when the hot microemulsion cooled down to room temperature (Joshi &amp; Patravale, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0064" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>). Lecithin, a truncated cone of double-hydrophobic tails and zwitter ionic large head group phospholipid was used as a surfactant for CIC-NLPs preparation. In this regard, not only the safety, biocompatibility (Mendes et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0084" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), and potent beneficial lecithin function in attenuating leukocytic reactions and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Jung et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0065" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), but also, the hydrophobic nature of oil soluble lecithin (HLB∼8) is important for stabilizing O/W nanoemulsion droplets with low tendency to desorb into the aqueous continuous phase (Athas et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0010" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). Yet, lecithin alone is not adequate to stabilize the remarkable increase of the newly formed surface area during the transition of nanoemulsion droplets to form NLPs by cooling crystallization and solidification. The low mobility of the formed lecithin vesicles make it difficult to reach and cover the newly formed bare interfacial surface immediately and this necessitates the addition of extra hydrophilic co-surfactant of high water solubility (Han et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>). Tween 80 was added to forms a reservoir of molecules that can be readily adsorbed to the interface to stabilize the naked newly formed interfacial region (Salminen et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0110" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). The three hydrophilic oxyethylene chains ‘hairs’ present on Tween 80 head group are extending to the aqueous phase, providing steric repulsive barrier between oil droplets leading to their stabilization and preventing their coalescence (Evans &amp; Wennerstrom, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0044" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>; Morrison, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0087" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2002</a></span>). The subsidiary interactions that took place between hydrophobic tails of both Lecithin and Tween 80 through Van der Waals forces in addition to the hydrogen bonding that occurs between hydroxyls on Tween’s 80 head and phosphate groups on lecithin’s head. Due to the latter favorable interactions, lecithin and Tween 80 are closely backed to each other at the O/W interface thus, creating stable persisting interfacial film (Shchipunov &amp; Shumilina, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0117" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1995</a></span>). Moreover, lecithin and Tween 80 differ in their alkyl chain (tails) saturation degree. Tween 80 has one <i>cis</i> unsaturated oleic acid chain, whereas, lecithin possesses two C16–C18 tails, one of them has two <i>cis</i> unsaturations and the other tail is saturated (Shchipunov &amp; Schmiedel, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0116" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1996</a></span>). The existence of <i>cis</i> unsaturations assures that the tails remain liquid like at room temperature (Evans &amp; Wennerstrom, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0044" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>; Morrison, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0087" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2002</a></span>). In contrast, the saturated tail tends to be rigid and solid at the same temperature which is vital for NLPs formation. We believe that all factors together demonstrate the synergy between lecithin and Tween 80 for the formation of stable CIC-NLP.</p>

   <p>NLPs size is a key parameter that affects tissue penetration and cellular internalization. Particles &lt;500 nm have efficient intracellular internalization and deep deposition while those larger than 500 nm are taken up by phagocytosis (Elena Fernández Fernández et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0032" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Zhao &amp; Stenzel, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0140" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). A wide PS distribution was obtained from 16 runs, ranging from 222.6 ± 4.52 nm (NLP1) to 1694 ± 13.07 nm (NLP9). The results revealed that all the investigated factors and their combined interactions have significantly contributed (<i>p</i>&lt;&nbsp;.05) to PS in a direct proportional manner with high coefficient of determination value (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.969) indicating a good model fit for the data except liquid lipid type (<i>p</i>&gt;&nbsp;.05). The effect of independent variables on PS was illustrated in the following linear regression equation after eliminating the non-significant terms: <span class="NLM_disp-formula-image disp-formula rs_preserve">

It is evident that all formulae (NLP9–NLP16) prepared with high homogenization speed of 20,000 rpm have unfavorable large PS than those prepared using 10,000 rpm (NLP1–NLP8). This trend could be attributed to the system over processing where the additional energy input increases the knocking frequency between particles leading to coalescence and size enlargement (Anarjan et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0008" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). The 3D surface plot in <a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1905747" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure S1(A–D)</a> showed the prevalence of green area at higher speed indicating an increase in PS, while the grow of acceptable blue area with speed inclination to 10,000 rpm, indicates significant size reduction. Similarly, increasing liquid lipid concentration in (NLP 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15) has significantly increased PS due to particles core swelling with liquid lipid (Granja et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0048" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). This is because at high temperature, there is a complete miscibility between melted solid and liquid lipids forming one phase. But during cooling process, and due to the miscibility gap between solid and liquid lipid, phase separation took place which is necessary for particles production and oil droplets precipitated inside the solid lipid matrix (Kovacevic et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0070" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). Furthermore, the glycerides alkyl chain length forming solid lipids can potentially affect PS. NLPs prepared using compritol are significantly (<i>p</i>=&nbsp;.021) of higher PS than those of precirol as shown in <a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1905747" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure S1(A, B)</a>, where the prevalence of acceptable blue region was quite low when compritol was used indicating that the size was significantly increased. This is directly linked to the more hydrophobic compritol of longer chain length (C22) which hamper its dispersion in aqueous media and produce more viscous dispersion that reduce the homogenization efficiency in decreasing PS compared to short (C16–C18) more hydrophilic precirol (Durán-Lobato et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0031" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Elmowafy et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0041" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). As a result, small PS below 500 nm was achieved in formulations NLPs 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Concurrently, PDI which measure the size distribution and the uniformity of the prepared NLPs is a fundamental attribute for their effective stability, efficacy, and high tissue accumulation (Danaei et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0027" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Ideally, for a uniform monodisperse system, PDI value should be close to 0.0 whereas a value of less than 0.3 represents acceptable narrow size distribution (Ong et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0094" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). A wide PDI range was obtained for the prepared CIC-NLPs ranging from 0.053 ± 0.018 to 0.946 ± 0.033 (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>). ANOVA results revealed that, both homogenization speed (B) and solid lipid type (C) have significantly contributed (<i>p</i>=&nbsp;.0004 and <i>p</i>=&nbsp;.0161, respectively) to PDI in a direct proportional manner (<a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1905747" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure S1(E–H)</a>).

Both the lipophilic CIC nature associated with its high solubility in the selected lipids together with the voids created due to the imperfection caused by the combination of liquid and solid lipid were assigned to the improved EE% and accommodation of more CIC molecules (Mendes et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0084" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).

   <p><button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button> reveals that, the systems developed at higher oil ratio (7:3) showed lower EE% than those attained at lower level (9:1) (<i>p</i>=&nbsp;.0068) due to the expulsion of the excess oil that could not be accommodated by the solid lipid during crystallization process. When the liquid lipid concentration exceeds the holding capacity of the used solid lipid, the oil phase with the contained solubilized drug was ejected resulting in drug accumulation at the outer shell of the nanoparticles and thus reducing the EE% (Soleimanian et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0124" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Moreover, the careful inspection of NLPs 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14, endorsed that using compritol as solid lipid was concurrently decreasing EE% compared to precirol (<i>p</i>=&nbsp;.022). This result correlated well with the higher solubility of CIC in precirol and the presence of relative higher amount of mono-glycerides that possess surfactant properties (8–22%) (Abdel-Salam et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0001" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) than compritol (12–18%) (Kallakunta et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0066" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) which contribute in dissolving more drug and impart more looser and porous structure for CIC accommodation thereby explain its higher CIC entrapment and loading (Khames et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0069" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).</p>
   <p>Therefore, in view of the aforementioned results, four NLPs 2, 4, 6, and 8 of PS &lt;500 nm, PDI &lt;0.3 and maximum EE% were processed for further <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> release evaluation.</p>

  <p>The Franz diffusion cell apparatus provided a more discriminative profile in the current work than the conventional large volume dissolution apparatus that may lack a well <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i>–<i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> correlation (Elkady et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0035" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). CIC release profile followed a biphasic pattern characterized by an initial burst after 1 h (15.88–20.07%) followed by a controlled release for 48 h (<a href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>). The rapid cooling and disparity in melting behavior between solid and liquid lipid during NLPs preparation result in expulsion of oil and superficial DL in the outer layers of the NLPs (Lim et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0078" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). Therefore, increasing the amount of drug loaded on the outer shell as depicted in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>, would account for more drug released at the initial stage (NLP 4 &gt; 8&gt;2 &gt; 6) (Huang et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0057" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). In the latter phase, the encapsulated CIC was released in a sustained manner over 48 h from deeper liquid and solid lipid cores by means of erosion and diffusion mechanisms (Almousallam et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0006" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). This combination of the burst and the sustained drug release is particularly beneficial for local treatment of bronchial asthma where, burst release will result in immediate pulmonary anti-inflammatory effect while, sustained release is expected to prolong CIC pulmonary residence time and increase its lung exposure thereby increasing the desired targeted pulmonary effects and limiting its penetration into systemic circulation and hence, diminish the drawbacks associated with CIC frequent dosing (Moreno-Sastre et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0086" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). On the other hand, the difference in cumulative drug release at the end of 48 h, could be arranged as follows: NLP4 &gt; NLP8 &gt; NLP6 &gt; NLP2 with 84.07, 75.73, 68.90, and 52.67% CIC release, respectively. This behavior is related to the difference of entire composition of NLPs where the lower precirol melting point induces greater mobility (NLP 4, 8) than compritol (NLP 2, 6) during the experimental release temperature leading to drug diffusion from lipid core with significant increase in cumulative drug release (El-Housiny et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0033" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Nevertheless, NLP4 release profile\was found to be significantly higher (<i>p</i>&lt;&nbsp;.05) than NLP8 which mainly could be ascribed to NLP4 reduced PS that provides greater surface area.</p>

  <p>In order to figure out the drug release mechanism, <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> release profile for NLPs was fitted in different kinetic models (zero order, first order, Higuchi equations, Hixson–Crowell, and Korsmeyer–Peppas). A linear relationship between the amount of drug released and square root of time was obtained indicating Higuchi’s diffusion model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.934). Based on Korsmeyer–Peppas models, the magnitude of release exponent ‘n’ was found to be 0.618 within the range of 0.85&gt;<i>n</i> &gt; 0.43, which implies that, CIC release obeys non-Fickian diffusion mechanism (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.973), depending on the degradation of the lipid chain rather than water penetration into the matrix (Gonzalez-Mira et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0047" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Consequently, based on the optimization of the factorial design and the desirability function evaluated using Design-Expert software, NLP4 showed the highest desirability index (<i>D</i> = 0.964) with the best attributes of the lowest PS (222.6 nm) and PDI (0.23), maximum EE (93.3%), and highest CIC release of 84% after 48 h.</p>

  <p>The morphology of NLP4 analyzed using TEM revealed spherical, well-identified discrete nanoparticles with PS correlates well with the size obtained from PCS (<a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1905747" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure S2</a>), with a desirable negative high ZPs of −40.0 mV necessary for adequate repulsion between the nanoparticles, thus preventing their aggregation and ensures a long-term physically stable system (Yousry et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0135" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). The acquired –ve charge is very advantageous for the safe internalization of NLPs into the cells by endocytosis, avoiding cytotoxicity and detrimental impact commonly induced by positively charged particles on the cell membranes (Zhao &amp; Stenzel, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0140" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i55">3.7. <i>In vitro</i> lung deposition study</h3>
  <p>Depending on PS, the deposition of aerosol particles at each stage of ACI is expected to mimic the deposition patterns at various regions of the human lung from upper airways to alveolus (Ali, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0005" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). Alveolar deposition is optimal with aerodynamic PS of 2–3 μm (Said-Elbahr et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0108" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>), while particles &gt;5&nbsp;µm are trapped in the upper airways and those less than 0.5&nbsp;µm are exhaled and fail to deposit (Silva et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0120" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>).</p>
  <p>The <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> aerosolization pattern of CIC–NLP4 following nebulization via ACI operating at flow rate of 28.3 l/min was assessed. MMAD and GSD that reflects the spread of the aerodynamic particle distribution (Arbain et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0009" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) as well as FPF% (the respirable fraction that is most likely to deposit in the deep lung) (Silva et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0120" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) were all determined and used as the key aspects to characterize the respirability of the developed CIC-NLPs dispersion.</p>
  <p>It was perceived from <a href="#F0004">Figure 4</a> that, the total amount of CIC deposited in all ACI stages from stage 2 to final filter was ∼87% (compared to ∼61% of commercial preparation) (Newman et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0093" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>). Herein, the highest proportion and the majority (∼50%) of CIC–NLP4 emitted dose were successfully deposited in the lower stages, stage 5 with 33.88 ± 4.17% deposition and stage 6 with 15.48 ± 3.98% representing the peripheral region including small airways and alveoli (Arbain et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0009" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). On the contrary, despite the small aerodynamic PS of the commercial CIC–MDI and the use of aero-spacer to minimize the oropharynx deposition, all previous HFA CIC–MDI reports revealed consistent drug loss of ∼35–40% due to the induction port-mouth piece deposition (Boulet et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0019" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Newman et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0093" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Nave &amp; Mueller, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0092" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) compared with negligible deposition of only 8% of the nebulized CIC–NLP4. The impaction results revealed an ideal measured MMAD of 2.03 ± 0.19&nbsp;µm which was well correlated with the standard recommendations and optimal properties for small airways aerosolization (Corren &amp; Tashkin, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0025" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>; Douafer et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0029" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). Not only MMAD is important, but also GSD (which is one standard deviation above and below the MMAD) could greatly affect the therapeutic effectiveness of the developed inhaled CIC dispersion. The determined GSD was 2.3 ± 0.24 indicating broad aerodynamic diameter of CIC-NLPs around the mean MMAD, thus allowing them to be dispersed at different impactor stages. This profile could be of considerable therapeutic advantage for asthma treatment where, asthma patients could benefit from the possible targeting of the entire airway tree where the treating of the small airway region by poly disperse CIC-NLPs was achieved (Lavorini et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0074" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). In addition to MMAD and GSD, FPF% was used to gauge the efficiency of lung deposition (Bharatwaj et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0017" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). The developed CIC–NLP4 revealed higher FPF% of 84.51 ± 5.1% exceeding the commercial CIC–MDI (FPF of 54%) (Drollmann et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0030" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>) and the previous reported exclusive nebulized CIC study (FPF of 43.3%) (Fu et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0045" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Therefore, the aerosolization ACI results evidenced higher FPF% accompanied by lower MMAD and GSD, minimal oropharyngeal deposition and greater dose delivery to the lung than MDI which supports the developed CIC–NLP4 as efficient treatment of bronchial asthma since it possesses all the features to render it inhalable with deep lung deposition.</p>

  <p><a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1905747" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure S3</a> displays DSC thermograms obtained for pure CIC, NLP4 physical mixture, and CIC–NLP4. Pure CIC showed sharp melting endothermic peak at 210 °C which was retained in its physical mixture indicating the persistence of drug crystalline nature and the lack of any interactions. When the components were processed as NLPs, the thermogram of CIC–NLP4 revealed the disappearance of CIC characteristic peak with shifting of lipid phase peak from 62 °C to 124 °C when compared to the physical mixture. This would confirm the presence of the drug in its amorphous state and the distortion of the lipid matrix crystalline nature due to the presence of liquid lipid and surfactants inside the lipid matrix leading to crystal lattice defects during phase transition to support drug accommodation (Salem et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0109" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>).</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i58">3.9. <i>In vitro</i> cytotoxicity assay</h3>
  <p>The toxicity profile of the optimized CIC–NLP4 is influenced by the nature and the type of lipids, surfactants, drug used as well as their proportion and concentration in the formulation (Guilherme et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0050" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). The safety and efficacy results performed on human epithelial cell line A549 after incubation for 72 h are illustrated in <a href="#F0005">Figure 5</a>. No evidence of cell viability reduction by more than 30% was noticed and all cell survival values exceed 70% at all tested concentrations (∼74%±1.18% for the highest concentration of 100 μg/ml) denoting well tolerated formulation (Gartziandia et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0046" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Levy et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0076" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) and considering CIC–NLP4 as cytocompatible without imparting cytotoxic effect up to a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Therefore, the lipids used with the optimum Tween 80 concentration are safe to achieve small size, biocompatible, and nontoxic CIC-NLPs without cell damaging effect of the excess unbound surfactant (Jana et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0063" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). Hence, CIC–NLP4 was progressed to further <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> study to investigate its efficacy against allergic airway inflammation.</p>

   <p>CIC–NLP4 produced an anti-inflammatory activity that lasted for 48 h compared to CIC–MDI (starting from the last day of treatment), as the decline in cellular count was more significant in this group. Furthermore, CIC–NLP4 revealed a greater decline in the number of neutrophils, an aspect common in severe steroid-resistant asthma. This enhanced effect of CIC–NLP4 may be due to the ability of NLPs to enter and accumulate within the inflamed tissue thus, acting more efficiently (Matsuo et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0083" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>).</p>
   <p>Both treatment groups decreased lung weight index when compared to the OVA-challenged group by about 20% and 13%, respectively. Although the decrease was not significant, it can be attributed to the decreased inflammation-associated edema (<a class="ext-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10717544.2021.1905747" target="_blank">Supplementary Figure S4</a>).</p>
   <p>The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are critical to the initiation and potentiation of the airway inflammation and drivers of the remodeling response including mucous production, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, and epithelial cell proliferation (Kenyon et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0068" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). IL-4 enhanced the recruitment of eosinophils and basophils and switches B lymphocyte cells to the production of IgE which in turn, activates mast cells and basophils to release histamine and different cytokines in the bronchi. This explains the rise in the level of IgE in the serum of the OVA-group (71.3 ± 6.59 ng/ml).</p>
   <p>IL-13 in turn, initiates changes in airway epithelial, goblet, and smooth muscle cells that define the chronic remodeling response through activation of the JNK and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) pathways. CIC inhibits these pathways by inhibiting the translation and surface expression of IL-4Rs and preventing the action of JNK on STAT6 along with inhibiting the production of IL-4 and 13 (Yoshihiko et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0134" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>). OVA induced a significant elevation of IL-4 and IL-13 concentration in the lung homogenate. Our BALF showed that IL-4 and IL-13 were significantly lower in the CIC treated groups compared to the OVA group (33.52% and 27.47% for CIC–NLP4 and 49.1% and 48.56% for CIC–MDI, respectively).</p>
   <p>CIC–NLP4 decreased the levels of IL-4 and IL-13 by 15.6% and 21.1% (<a href="#F0006">Figure 6(A)</a>) and IgE by 14% more compared to CIC–MDI (<a href="#F0006">Figure 6(B)</a>). Despite the lower dose, CIC–NLP4 was able to produce better anti-inflammatory effects than CIC–MDI. This can be attributed to the nanoparticle protection of CIC from the enzymatic degradation in the airways enabling a more potent Th2 lymphocyte inhibitory effect, better lung deposition, and the prolonged release of the drug (Kenyon et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0068" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>).</p>

   <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by several cell types in the respiratory tract including epithelial cells, airway nerves, inflammatory cells, and vascular endothelial cells. It is an important mediator implicated in the progression of asthma where, extensive production of NO is cytotoxic and produces marked pathological alterations including inflammatory cellular infiltration, mucus production, and airway edema during asthma exacerbations (El-Kashef, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0038" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of NO and is regulated at a pre-translational level where it can be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (Ricciardolo, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0105" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>). In the current study, NO was increased fivefold and TNF-α by threefold in the diseased group compared to the control group (<a href="#F0006">Figure 6(C)</a>). CIC represses TNF-α signaling (Sasse et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0114" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>) and decreases NO through the binding to glucocorticoid receptors and inhibiting its iNOS transcription (Griffiths et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0049" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>).</p>
   <p>CIC–NLP4 significantly decreased the levels of BALF TNF-α and NO compared to CIC–MDI. CIC–NLP4 showed 22% lower levels of TNF-α and 34% lower levels of NO than the CIC–MDI. We hypothesize that this improvement is due to lecithin used in the CIC–NLP4 formula. It has been reported that lecithin possesses an anti-inflammatory effect and can lower the levels of TNF-α (Jung et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0065" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) either by inhibiting the neutrophil leukocyte-mediated microcirculatory inflammatory reactions (Hartmann et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0053" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>) and by inhibiting the transcription of iNOS and reducing the NO concentration (Erõs et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0043" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>).</p>

   <p>OVA significantly increased lung MDA content, an index of lipid peroxidation, by about fivefold in comparison with control group (11.5 and 2.25 ng/g tissue, respectively) with significant decrease in SOD activity by about sixfold (<i>p</i>&lt;.05) (<a href="#F0007">Figure 7</a>). Inhalation of CIC in both treatment groups significantly decreased OVA-induced increase in MDA content to 35.6% and 55.5%, respectively.

   <p>Oxidative stress contributes in asthma via activation of the NFκB pathway and enhancing the activation of eosinophilic extracellular traps (Silveira et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0121" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Besides protein damage to several enzymes, including SOD (Comhair et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0024" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>), oxidative stress results in the hyper phosphorylation and inhibition of HDAC2 enzyme resulting in the development of corticosteroid-resistant asthma (Chung &amp; Marwick, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0023" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). Our study corroborates with other studies reporting an increase in oxidative stress markers in OVA-induced asthma (Nadeem et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0090" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>; Zeng et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0138" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>).</p>
   <p>In the present study, we hypothesize that rapid onset of action in both formulations decreased cellular inflammation and thus, decreased the oxidative stress and MDA. In CIC–NLP4 group, there was a significant decrease in lung MDA content when compared with MDI. We attribute this to the use of Tween 80 and lecithin in our formula. Tween 80 (Pérez-Rosés et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0101" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) and lecithin (Pan et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0096" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) were reported to have antioxidative properties that can be useful in aiding healing injured tissue (Nasab et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0091" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Bao et&nbsp;al. went for the potential use of lecithin for the treatment of airway inflammatory diseases due to its potent antioxidant effect (Bao et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0012" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>).</p>
   <p>Tween 80 in CIC–NLP4 was also reported to inhibit P-glycoprotein (Li-Blatter et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0077" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>), a drug efflux pump encoded by the multidrug-resistance gene 1 that transports glucocorticoids out of the cells thereby, reducing the intracellular glucocorticoid concentration and decreasing the efficiency of treatment despite the high concentration of glucocorticoids (Xu et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0132" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). This improved effect of Tween 80 may account for the prolonged activity of our formula explaining greater efficiency of CIC–NLP4 over CIC–MDI despite the smaller dose of our formula.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i66">3.10.4. Western blot analysis</h4>
   <p>Phosphorylated NF-Κb65 is a transcription factor responsible for upregulating pro-inflammatory genes including TNF-α (Barnes, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0014" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). The OVA-induced asthma resulted in the elevation of phosphorylated p65 by more than sixfold compared to the control group. This increase was diminished by CIC where, CIC–NLP4 was able to reduce the phosphorylated p65 by 64% which was significantly lower than CIC–MDI (<a href="#F0008">Figure 8</a>). We believe that lecithin played a role in inhibiting the activation of NFκB as was reported by others (Cheng et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Choudhary et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0022" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Treede et&nbsp;al. proposed a mechanism through which the effect on NFκB is through preventing its activation via TNF-α by causing a shift of the TNF-α receptors at the membrane surface to lipid rafts (Treede et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0125" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>).</p>

   <p>To evaluate the effects of CIC on the histopathology of OVA-induced allergic asthma, histological changes of lung tissues with and without CIC treatment were detected by H&amp;E staining (<a href="#F0009">Figure 9</a>). In the control group, there was no histopathological alteration and normal histological structure of the bronchiole as well as the peribronchiolar blood vessels and air alveoli were observed. In contrast, all OVA-sensitized and challenged mice showed peribronchiolar tissue with focal inflammatory cells infiltration as well as congestion in the blood vessels. Focal collapse was observed in the air alveoli associated with perivascular inflammatory cells aggregation indicating that our asthma model was well established. However, treatments with CIC remarkably ameliorated OVA-induced lung injury and inflammatory cells infiltration despite the presence of congestion in the peribronchiolar blood vessels and diffuse emphysema in the air alveoli. This improvement confirms the deep deposition of the drug as was previously proven by the <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> lung deposition experiment. The insignificance of improvement between the two formulations is most probably due to the short treatment period although it was considered a great advantage to CIC-NLPs as the same effect was obtained at a lower dose. The relatively higher efficiency of CIC–NLP4 in preventing asthma inflammation over CIC–MDI may be attributed to the encapsulation of CIC in NLPs forming spherical shape and small nanoparticle size below 260 nm that can escape macrophage lung clearance (Patlolla et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0100" data-reflink="_i71 _i72" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) inducing deep drug deposition in a controlled release manner.</p>

 <p>Owing to the prevalence of asthma, the present study explored safe, convenient nebulization mode for lung delivery of CIC. Lipid nanoformulation with favorable specific inhaled characteristics was developed to deliver CIC deep to the small airways, the inflammation target at lower dose, reduced oropharyngeal deposition, and prolonged release manner to avoid the incidence of side effects associated with ICSs. Most importantly, the merits of the developed nebulizable CIC–NLP4 display superior <i>in&nbsp;vitro</i> and <i>in&nbsp;vivo</i> properties when compared with the commercial CIC–MDI therapy. The successful high CIC payload together with the potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of the combined surfactant use of Tween 80–lecithin were behind the proved significant efficacy in the mitigation of the allergic airways inflammations and the magnitude of therapeutic cure using only 40&nbsp;µg, half CIC commercial MDI dose. Overall, the aerosol properties obtained in this work (high FPF% and deep lung deposition) together with the sustained release profile encourage the once daily therapeutic use of CIC at half its commercial dose and hold great promise in the therapeutic modality of bronchial asthma. Consequently, future clinical studies on asthmatic patients are recommended.</p>
