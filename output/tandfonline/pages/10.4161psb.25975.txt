 <p>Phylogenic analysis using the entire amino acid sequences of NIN and NIN homologs of pea (PsNIN)<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R14" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>14</sup></a></span> and <i>M. truncatula</i> (MtNIN),<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R15" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>15</sup></a></span> and NLPs from <i>L. japonicus</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i>, provided an un-rooted phylogenic tree (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1B</a>), which is similar to the tree generated in a previous report.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R12" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>12</sup></a></span> Bootstrap values at nodes of this phylogenic tree suggested that NIN, LjNLP1, AtNLP1–5, PsNIN, and MtNIN form a clade, which includes a subgroup consisting of NIN and its homologs. Schauser et al. previously proposed 6 blocks of conservation in amino acid sequences of NIN and NLPs;<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R4" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>4</sup></a></span> consecutively arranged 4 blocks (I to V) form the N-terminal conserved region as a whole, whereas blocks V and VI correspond to the RWP-RK domain and the PB1 domain, respectively (<a href="#SM0001">Fig. S1</a>). Furthermore, as the amino acid sequence in a region spanning block I to block II of NIN is different from those of NLPs, it has been also proposed that the unique amino acid sequence within the N-terminal conserved region may characterize NIN and its homologs.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R4" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>4</sup></a></span> This unique amino acid was not found even in NjNLP1, but the corresponding sequences are conserved among 4 LjNLPs (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1C</a>). Thus, the result of our phylogenic analysis suggests that that NIN and its homologs have higher homologies with LjNLP1 and AtNLP1–5 rather than other NLPs overall, but a subgroup of NIN, PsNIN, and MtNIN was formed probably due to the fact that NIN and its homologs contain a unique amino acid sequence in their N-terminal regions (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1C</a>, <a href="#SM0001">Fig. S1</a>). The results of our phylogenic analysis also suggest the <i>NIN</i> gene evolved to function in the commitment of the developmental program of nodulation in legumes after the formation of subgroups of the <i>NIN/NLP</i> gene family in the plant kingdom.</p>
 <p>LjNLP1 is closer to NIN than LjNLP2–4 in the phylogenic tree. However, LjNLP1 as well as other LjNLPs probably plays a role in nitrate-regulated gene expression, because AtNLP4 and 5, rather than NIN, are closer to LjNLP1 (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1B</a>). Different expression patterns of <i>NIN</i> and <i>LjNLP1</i> genes also imply their different roles in <i>L. japonicus.</i> The expression of <i>NIN</i> is specific to cells involved in nodulation, consistent with a specific role of NIN in this process,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R2" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>2</sup></a></span> while the expression of LjNLP1 in both leaves and roots is reported in a database of <i>L. japonicus</i> genes (<a class="ext-link" href="http://cgi-www.cs.au.dk/cgi-compbio/Niels/index.cgi" target="_blank">http://cgi-www.cs.au.dk/cgi-compbio/Niels/index.cgi</a>).</p>
 <p>NIN and LjNLP1 were found to form a clade with AtNLP1–5 that bind to NRE<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R8" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>8</sup></a></span> (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1B</a>). Thus, we investigated whether NIN and LjNLP1 can similarly bind to NRE using the RWP-RK domains of NIN (553–666 a.a.) and LjNLP1 (575–690 a.a.) that had been expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins and purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The recombinant proteins formed a DNA-protein complex with the non-labeled DNA probe containing an NRE, while a thioredoxin negative control did not form this association (<a href="#F2">Fig.&nbsp;2A</a>). Furthermore, a non-labeled DNA probe could inhibit the complex formation between NIN and the labeled DNA probe. Although the complex formation of NIN appeared not to be very effective compared with AtNLP6 and LjNLP1, these results indicated that the RWP-RK domain of NIN is sufficient for DNA binding and also that NIN and the NLPs can bind to NRE sites in a sequence-specific manner, at least in vitro.</p>

 <p>To investigate whether NIN can bind to NRE in vivo and thereby regulate transcription via this interaction, we performed co-transfection experiments using effector plasmids containing <i>NIN</i>, <i>LjNLP1</i>, or <i>AtNLP6</i> cDNA under the control of a constitutive strong promoter, a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene (<i>LUC</i>) downstream of the NRE-containing promoter, and an internal control plasmid containing the β-glucuronidase reporter gene (<i>GUS</i>) fused to <i>A. thaliana</i> ubiquitin promoter (<a href="#F2">Fig.&nbsp;2B</a>). As shown in <a href="#F2">Figure&nbsp;2C</a>, NIN and LjNLP1 promoted the expression of <i>LUC</i> in <i>A. thaliana</i> mesophyll protoplasts, as did AtNLP6. Such activation was not evident using promoter with mutations in its NRE, suggesting the sequence-specific interaction of NIN and LjNLP1 in vivo. However, the fold activation by NIN was much lower than that by LjNLP1. Such weak transcriptional activation by NIN could be due to its lower expression, lower affinity to NRE in vivo, or lower transcriptional activation ability in mesophyll protoplasts, compared with LjNLP1. To clarify the reason for the lower activation ability of NIN, we performed an in vivo competition assay. When the expression vector for LjNLP1 was co-transfected into mesophyll protoplasts together with the expression vector for NIN, transcriptional activation by LjNLP1 was found to be reduced (<a href="#F2">Fig.&nbsp;2D</a>). Hence, NIN appears to be expressed at appreciable levels and to successfully bind to NRE, but to function as a weaker transcriptional activator than LjNLP1 in mesophyll protoplasts. The reason that NIN than LjNLP1 more dominantly exerted its effects on NRE-dependent transcription is currently uncertain. However, this phenomenon might be caused by effective expression of NIN protein than LjNLP1 protein in mesophyll protoplasts. Alternatively, as NIN and NLPs have a PB1 domain that may enable dimerization between PB1 domain-containing proteins,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R4" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>4</sup></a></span> NIN and LjNLP1 might form heterodimers of which transcriptional activation ability is comparable to that of NIN homodimers but much weaker than that of LjNLP1 homodimers. Taken together, our results suggest that the DNA-binding specificities of NIN and LjNLP1 are similar to that of the AtNLPs in vivo and in vitro and also that NIN and the NLPs can enhance transcription through their interaction with similar DNA sequences.</p>
 <p>We previously showed that AtNLP6, and probably other NLPs from A. <i>thaliana</i>, is post-translationally activated in response to nitrate signals through the N-terminal region flanking the RWP-RK DNA-binding domain.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R8" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>8</sup></a></span> Since NIN and the NLPs share homology even at the N-terminal region (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1A</a>, <a href="#SM0001">Fig. S1</a>), we tested the nitrate responsiveness of NIN and LjNLP1. In our previous analysis of the nitrate responsiveness of AtNLP6, effector constructs were introduced into an <i>A. thaliana</i> transgenic line harboring a reporter construct, and the resultant stable transformants were treated with or without nitrate, and reporter activity was measured.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R8" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>8</sup></a></span> However, as this assay system is time-consuming, we newly developed an alternative assay system for our present study using a biolistic particle delivery system, in which particles coated by effector plasmids are bombarded onto the roots of the <i>A. thaliana</i> transgenic line harboring the <i>GUS</i> reporter gene. The activity of the effectors is then evaluated by the numbers of cells showing GUS activity. In our current experiments, we used a <i>GUS</i> reporter gene under the control of the 35S minimal promoter fused to 8 copies of the LexA-binding site rather than the NRE (<a href="#F3">Fig.&nbsp;3A</a>). This was because NRE itself responds to nitrate due to the activity of endogenous NLPs, making it difficult to then evaluate the nitrate-responsiveness of particular effectors. We at first evaluated feasibility of this newly developed system by the use of LexA-VP16 fusion protein that promoted transcription independently of nitrate treatment and AtNLP6-LexA fusion protein that promoted transcription only after nitrate treatment.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R8" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>8</sup></a></span> As the results indicated that we could evaluate nitrate-responsiveness of transcription factors using this system (<a href="#F3">Fig.&nbsp;3B</a>), we examined nitrate-responsiveness of the N-terminal regions of NIN and LjNLP1. Similar to the N-terminal region of AtNLP6, the N-terminal region of LjNLP1 (1–585 a.a.) fused to LexA was found to enhance the expression of the <i>GUS</i> reporter gene in a nitrate-dependent manner. However, the N-terminal region of NIN (1–563 a.a.) fused to LexA was found to transactivate transcription independently of nitrate (<a href="#F3">Fig.&nbsp;3B</a>). Although NIN was observed to be a weaker transcription factor than LjNLP1 in leaf mesophyll protoplasts (<a href="#F2">Fig.&nbsp;2C and D</a>), NIN appeared to function as a transcriptional activator at a comparable or even stronger degree of potency than LjNLP1 in root cells.</p>

 <p>In our current study, we show that LjNLP1 and NIN are transcription factors with comparable DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activities but different nitrate responsiveness, although they are encoded by genes belonging to the same clade of the <i>NIN/NLP</i> gene family. Because NIN is an essential regulator during nodule formation,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R2" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>2</sup></a></span><sup>,</sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R3" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>3</sup></a></span> its nitrate-insensitivity is an important characteristic which is tightly associated with its physiological role. Nitrate inhibits nodulation, nodule development, and also symbiotic nitrogen assimilation in accordance with the fact that symbiotic nitrogen fixation is important in a nitrogen-deficient environment.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R16" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>16</sup></a></span><sup>-</sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R18" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>18</sup></a></span> If the activity of NIN required nitrate, as is the case with the NLPs, it could not regulate nodule formation in the absence of nitrate. Hence, the loss of nitrate-responsiveness of NIN appears to have been an essential molecular event in its evolution as a specific regulator of nodulation. We speculated that the unique amino acid sequence within the N-terminal region of NIN (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1C</a>) may be associated with the loss of nitrate-responsiveness of NIN, because NIN and LjNLP1 showed similar ability for transcriptional activation but different nitrate-responsiveness.</p>
 <p>As found for the <i>A. thaliana</i> NLPs, NIN and LjNLP1 can bind to an NRE and thereby promote transcription. Very recently, it was shown that NIN binds to the promoters of pectate lyase gene<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R19" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>19</sup></a></span> and NF-Y subunit gene.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R20" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>20</sup></a></span> Although the binding site on the pectate lyase gene promoter has not yet been identified, the binding sites on the NF-Y subunit gene promoters have been proposed with sequences that are similar to the NRE. Thus, NIN and LjNLP1 likely bind to similar sequences through their highly conserved RWP-RK domain <i>in planta</i>. It is currently uncertain whether the targets of NIN and NLPs are completely different or partially overlapping. Nitrate signaling oppositely regulates NIN and NLP activities. Nitrate represses the Nod factor-induced expression of the <i>NIN</i> gene<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R21" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>21</sup></a></span> and induces the post-translational activation of the NLPs.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R8" data-reflink="_i6" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>8</sup></a></span> Therefore, it is unlikely that NIN and the NLPs regulate the same genes in the same cells at the same time. However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that NIN and the NLPs regulate the expression of common genes in different cells. Further analysis of the target genes of NIN and the NLPs may help to elucidate how NIN, a member of a transcription factor family responsible for the regulation of nitrate-regulated gene expression, came to play a key role in symbiotic nodulation.</p>
