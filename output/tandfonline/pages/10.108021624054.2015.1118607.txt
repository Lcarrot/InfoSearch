 <p>GATA transcription factors contain one or 2 zinc finger domains, which bind to DNA motifs with the WGATAR consensus sequence, and are conserved in animals, plants and fungi. GATA factors perform various roles, but in their best-characterized role, serve as regulatory switches contributing to long-term cell fate decisions. Examples include fungal GATA transcription factors, which are pivotal for morphological cell differentiation and activation of metabolic networks<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001 cit0002" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>1,2</sup></a></span>; <i>Drosophila</i>'s Serpent and Pannier, which drive heart and haematopoietic differentiation<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>3</sup></a></span>; the vertebrate GATA4, 5 and 6, which play pivotal roles in endoderm differentiation<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004 cit0005" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>4,5</sup></a></span>; and the vertebrate GATA1, 2, and 3, which are important for haematopoietic differentiation, including lymphocyte terminal differentiation.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006 cit0007 cit0008" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>6-8</sup></a></span> In addition to their roles in differentiation, GATA transcription factors have been shown to take part in the regulation of induced stress responses.

 <h2 id="_i3" class="section-heading-2">From Embryonic to Adult Functions</h2>
 <p>ELT-2 is the dominant factor required for terminal differentiation in the intestine, and its ectopic expression was shown to be sufficient to drive expression of intestinal markers (i.e. the carboxylesterase gene <i>ges-1</i> and the intestinal intermediate filament gene <i>ifb-2</i>) outside of the intestine.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020 cit0030 cit0031" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>20,30,31</sup></a></span> Moreover, <i>elt-2</i> expression is maintained into adulthood, through autoregulation.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>21</sup></a></span> This suggested that <i>elt-2</i> was required for maintenance of intestinal function and structure in the adult. However, a study following the expression of intestinal markers showed that <i>elt-2</i> was not the sole intestinal regulator. For most tested intestinal genes, including <i>ifb-2</i> and <i>ges-1,</i> expression was co-dependent on a second intestinal GATA transcription factor, <i>elt-7</i>, which functions redundantly with <i>elt-2</i>.<sup>31</sup> Redundancy is a common theme in the contribution of GATA transcription factors.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032 cit0033 cit0034 cit0035" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>32-35</sup></a></span> Furthermore, knock-down of <i>elt-2</i> in adults was found to be insufficient to affect <i>ifb-2</i> expression, or the expression of other genes encoding intestinal structural proteins, including the intestine-specific actin isoform <i>act-5</i>, and the adherens junction protein <i>let-413</i>.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022 cit0029" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>22,29</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, <i>elt-2</i>'s contribution remains dominant in adults for the expression of a more specific subset of intestinal genes enriched for genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, such as lysozymes, peptidases and lipases.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29</sup></a></span> Such genes were previously shown to make up a significant part of those expressed in the adult <i>C. elegans</i> intestine,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>30</sup></a></span> and may contribute both to digestive functions and to protection from bacterial pathogens.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
 <p>Similar to the developmental contributions of <i>elt-2</i> in the intestine, activation of <i>elt-3</i> expression (by ELT-1) immediately following the terminal division of cell lineages that give rise to most epidermal cells, is thought to signify a shift from epidermal cell fate specification to epidermal differentiation. Supporting its importance for epidermal cell identity, ectopic expression of <i>elt-3</i> activated the expression of epidermal markers in non-epidermal tissues.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>14</sup></a></span> However, worms lacking <i>elt-3</i> are viable, and maintain epidermal cell differentiation, attesting to redundancy in <i>elt-3</i>'s contribution to epidermal development.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>14</sup></a></span> ELT-1 was suggested to be the transcription factor complementing the function of ELT-3 in <i>elt-3</i> mutants<i>.</i> Alternatively, an ELT-1-induced second transcription factor, NHR-25, was shown to share 50% of its targets (identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation, or ChIP) with ELT-3, suggesting that it might be the one functioning redundantly with ELT-3 instead of ELT-1<sup>36</sup>. ELT-3 expression peaks at embryonic stages, but persists at low levels (putatively through autoregulation) into late larval stages and adulthood.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>14</sup></a></span> Supporting autoregulation, ChIP-identified ELT-3 targets (http://data.modencode.org)<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0037" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>37</sup></a></span> included the <i>elt-3</i> promoter.</p>

  <p>Accumulating evidence indicates that in adults ELT-2 contributes to immune protection. Disruption of <i>elt-2</i> results in decreased resistance to various bacterial pathogens, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, as well as to ingested fungi like <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022 cit0023" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>22,23</sup></a></span> Contribution to immune protection is not a by-product of general malaise, as worms in which <i>elt-2</i> was knocked down only during adulthood still have a normal lifespan.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>22</sup></a></span> ELT-2 is also required for protection from osmotic stress. This may represent involvement in adaptation to environmental conditions, but was alternatively suggested to represent toxin-induced damage caused by certain pathogens, as osmotic stress responses showed a significant overlap with those caused by Cry5B, a pore-forming toxin from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>25</sup></a></span> Support for the emerging theme of ELT-2 as a regulator of pathogen resistance was further provided by a study of <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i> infection in <i>C. elegans</i>, which highlighted ELT-2 as a target in the evolutionary arms race, targeted for proteosomal degradation, which depended on the pathogen's type III secretion system.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>38</sup></a></span></p>

  <p>The <i>C. elegans</i> p38 pathway plays pivotal roles in <i>C. elegans</i> stress responses, in particular in responses to oxidative stress and infection. Two transcription factors have been shown to mediate its contributions – ATF-7 for infection responses, and SKN-1 for both oxidative stress and infection responses.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042 cit0043 cit0044 cit0045" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>42-45</sup></a></span> Genetic analyses performed could not weigh-in on whether the p38 pathway interacted directly with ELT-2; however, they showed that <i>elt-2</i> functioned downstream of the p38 pathway, and cooperated with both <i>atf-7</i> and <i>skn-1</i> in inducing different subsets of the infection response (<a href="#f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></a>).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029 cit0046" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29,46</sup></a></span> While induction of genes of one subset was fully dependent on <i>elt-2</i> and <i>atf-7</i>, induction of genes of the other subset required, in addition, <i>skn-1</i><sup>29</sup>. ATF-7 is a repressor of infection-response genes, which becomes an enhancer upon phosphorylation by the p38 kinase PMK-1<sup>45</sup>. Accordingly, RNAi-mediated knock-down of <i>atf-7</i> dramatically increased target gene expression in the absence of infection. However, a simultaneous disruption of <i>elt-2</i> abolished this increase, demonstrating a dominant role for ELT-2 in gating ATF-7 and in regulating its targets.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29</sup></a></span> With regards to SKN-1, it is yet unknown whether its contribution to immune responses was due to direct activation by the p38 MAPK pathway, or secondary to production of reactive oxygen species as part of the immune response; previous studies have demonstrated both modes of activation.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042 cit0043" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>42,43</sup></a></span> These results support a model in which ELT-2 functions as a master regulator of intestinal immune gene expression, cooperating with transcription factors that are directly activated by the p38 pathway. This is reminiscent of the model proposed for the contribution of <i>Drosophila</i>'s Serpent to circadian gene expression in which a combination of a tissue-specific stable regulator with inputs from broadly-expressed, signal-activated transcription factors provides tissue-specific induction.</p>

  <p>DAF-16 is arguably the best-characterized stress-activated transcription factor, known for its pivotal role in lifespan extension following disruption of insulin signaling.

Comparisons of ChIP-identified target lists further shows that a third of ELT-3's targets are also bound (in L4 larvae) by the stress regulator SKN-1, much more than would be expected by chance, suggesting a greater involvement of ELT-3 in stress gene regulation than currently appreciated. Lastly, while ELT-2 was shown to be essential for DAF-16-dependent expression of many intestinal targets, ELT-3 seems to have a similar role in epidermal DAF-16-dependent gene expression, although it does not demonstrate a significant contribution to lifespan.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>50</sup></a></span> Taken together, different lines of evidence support the possibility that much like ELT-2 in the intestine, ELT-3 may serve as an epidermal master regulator enabling local stress responses.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, knock-down of NHR-25, the same transcription factor mentioned above as a potential redundant partner for ELT-3 during epidermal differentiation, was found to result in induction of epidermal infection genes, including the ELT-3-regulated <i>nlp</i> genes.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>54</sup></a></span> Unlike ELT-3, NHR-25 can be found both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0055" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>55</sup></a></span> Thus, while <i>nhr-25</i> knock-down may affect immune gene expression indirectly through impairment to epidermal cell structures, it is tempting to speculate an alternative possibility in which NHR-25 cooperates with ELT-3 in regulating induced immune responses. The observation that knock-down of <i>nhr-25</i> leads to <i>nlp</i> gene induction, indicating involvement in gene repression under normal conditions, further suggests that a cooperation between ELT-3 and NHR-25 may be similar to that observed between ELT-2 and ATF-7.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
  <p>Two additional response activators are intriguing as potential partners of ELT-3 in regulating epidermal immune and stress responses. First, STA-2, a STAT transcription factor-like protein, was proposed to be phosphorylated by the p38 pathway following either fungal infection or wounding, and was shown to regulate epidermal immune gene expression.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>56</sup></a></span> Activation of the p38 pathway (which was shown by others to occur either downstream of the GPA-12&nbsp;G-protein α subunit, or of the Tribbles-like kinase NIPI-3<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0024 cit0057" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>24,57</sup></a></span>) was suggested to shift STA-2 into the nucleus to induce immune gene expression (<a href="#f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></a>)<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>56</sup></a></span>; translocation of STA-2 from the apical membrane to the nucleus was reported by another study following severe structural damage to the epidermis, although under these conditions the p38 pathway was not required.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i9 _i11 _i12" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>58</sup></a></span> Second, SMA-3, a downstream mediator of TGFβ signaling, was found to be necessary for gene induction during <i>Drechmeria</i> infection. SMA-3 was necessary specifically for the induction of caenacin genes, which, as mentioned above, are also binding-targets of ELT-3<sup>59</sup>. Thus, the involvement of ELT-3 in either STA-2-, or SMA-dependent gene expression would be of interest.</p>

 <h2 id="_i8" class="section-heading-2">Conclusions</h2>
 <p>Accumulating evidence supports the notion that in the adult intestine ELT-2 functions as a master regulator for induced responses, in particular during infection, but potentially also under other types of stress. In this capacity ELT-2 appears to differ from vertebrate GATA transcription factors, which were described to be directly activated by signal transduction pathways. Instead, it resembles <i>Drosophila</i>'s Serpent, which was reported to mediate gene regulation by other transcription factors. Certain functional characteristics of ELT-2 are shared with the epidermal GATA transcription factor ELT-3. Such parallels suggest a similar mode of function, and further suggest that ELT-2's contribution to immune responses may represent a more general theme in the function of GATA transcription factors.</p>
