 <h2 id="_i3" class="section-heading-2">I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>Human errors in safety-critical systems, such as nuclear power plants (NPPs), have been an important topic of research in the field of human factors. The Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents sparked interest in nuclear safety around the world. These accidents revealed that plant operators may not always adequately handle and process the large volume of information and that the high workload and stress during abnormal events can severely affect their performance. In fact, it is reported that human errors accounted for 40% of the failures during startup and shutdown operation from 1997 to 2017 at NPPs in Korea because of the operator burden arising from monitoring hundreds of parameters for an extended period.<sup>1</sup> A 1985 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) study showed that upward of 65% of commercial nuclear system failures involve human error.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2</a></span></sup> Human-caused accidents remain rare, and most human errors do not have an impact on plant safety. Nonetheless, human errors can result in downtime for plants as systems are reset or repaired and root cause analyses are performed to ensure continued safe operations.</p>
 <p>The analysis of incidents in the nuclear industry over the past few decades has spawned a great deal of research into the critical role played by human factors in ensuring low human error rates and maintaining the reliability of NPPs. Recent developments in digital technology and information technology and ergonomics have accelerated digitization and design innovation in the nuclear industry. Specifically, the involvement of human factors in the design of NPPs has gained considerable attention. Traditional alarm systems and many analog instruments and displays have already been replaced by more recent digitized systems. Many operator support systems have been created to assist operators in evaluating conditions, providing computerized procedures, and regulating their operations in response to changing circumstances. Beyond operation, human errors related to maintenance and modifications also have a significant influence on plant safety.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002 cit0003 cit0004 cit0005" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2–5</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Although NPPs have become increasingly digital over the years, the design of digital solutions has not always been optimized to simplify the work of operators. There is a need to build “intelligent” operator support systems that can accurately assess the safety status of the NPP in real time and realize intelligent human-machine interaction. Specifically, such smart systems should assist operators in making mission-critical decisions and performing timely actions to reduce the risk in the operational safety of NPPs.</p>
 <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the potential to bring this kind of intelligence and revolutionize this important industry. Artificial intelligence can be defined as the study of “intelligent agents”: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span></sup> In recent decades, AI, and especially deep learning, which is a machine learning method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), has made considerable progress.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span></sup> Modern AI-powered systems such as smart devices, mobile phones, and virtual assistants are ubiquitous today. With the development and popularity of AI, many researchers have considered how this technology could be applied to NPPs to reduce errors overall (not just human errors), provide useful guidance to operators, and help them make accurate and rapid decisions while ensuring and potentially enhancing the safety of nuclear energy production.</p>
 <p>This work reviews the common human errors in the operation and maintenance of NPPs and explores the role AI technology can play in mitigating the risk of human failures and improving the performance of NPPs.</p>

 <h2 id="_i4" class="section-heading-2">II. BACKGROUND</h2>
 <p>Human reliability analysis (HRA) is the study of human contributions to human error and the quantification of human error (e.g., rates, probabilities) for use in overall risk models. Historically, human factors and human reliability have diverged, whereby human factors engineering has tended to focus on understanding factors that influence human performance in sociotechnical systems to improve the design of those systems, while HRA has tended to focus on safety and risk factors, including as-built systems like existing nuclear facilities.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> These two fields converge with the introduction of new analytical tools such as AI. Traditional HRA uses worksheets and subject matter experts to predict the factors that will contribute to human errors. This approach depends on the subjectivity of analysts and can result in considerable inter-analyst variability. The advent of AI techniques in HRA promises the opportunity to minimize such subjectivity and provide a more consistent tool for HRA. Additionally, where the causes of human error are identified, AI can provide technology to assist operators in preventing and mitigating errors.</p>
 <div id="s0002-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i5">II.A. Causes of Human Error</h3>
  <p>Human performance is the product of the context in which the human operates. While humans have some tendencies to commit errors even in the most positive contexts, such error is considered random. Some contexts, however, clearly drive success or failure. In HRA, the systematic review of these contexts is treated through performance shaping factors (PSFs), also referred to as performance influencing factors and common performance characteristics in different parts of the research community.</p>
  <p>The earliest HRA method, the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> (THERP) captures most contexts as predefined scenarios. The analyst matches scenarios under analysis to these predefined scenarios in THERP. This process proves somewhat limited because the predefined scenarios are not extensible, resulting in a degree of force fitting. THERP has limited coverage of PSFs to cover operator stress and experience levels, which serve as modifiers on the nominal human error probability levels extracted from scenario matching. Descendants of THERP, like the Standard Plant Analysis Risk–Human Reliability Analysis (SPAR-H) method,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>10</a></span></sup> expand the process to let PSFs cover most of the context without scenario matching. SPAR-H features a list of eight PSFs: Available Time, Stress/Stressors, Complexity, Experience/Training, Procedures, Ergonomics/Human–Machine Interface, Fitness for Duty, and Work Processes. The SPAR-H analyst assigns a level for each PSF, resulting in a positive effect, neutral or nominal effect, or a negative effect on performance. The subjective level of the PSF influence translates to a multiplier on a nominal human error probability.</p>
  <p>A proliferation of HRA methods to cover different applications and contexts results in an ever-growing list of possible PSFs. While HRA methods are mostly grounded in their specific and fixed sets of PSFs, the impression across methods is that no single HRA method covers all possible PSFs. Efforts to standardize the list of relevant PSFs have emerged. NUREG-1792, “Good Practices for Implementing Human Reliability Analysis,”<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span></sup> provides a standard list of 15 PSFs to cover human actions in response to plant upset conditions:</p>
  <ol class="NLM_list NLM_list-list_type-order">
   <li><p class="inline">applicability and suitability of training and experience</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">suitability of relevant procedures and administrative controls</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">availability and clarity of instrumentation</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">time available and time required to complete the action</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">the complexity of required diagnosis and response</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">workload, time pressure, and stress</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">team/crew dynamics and crew characteristics</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">available staffing and resources</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">ergonomic quality of human-system interface (HSI)</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">environment in which the action needs to be performed</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">accessibility and operability of equipment to be manipulated</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">need for special tools</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">communications</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">special fitness needs</p></li>
   <li><p class="inline">consideration of “realistic” accident sequence diversions and deviations (e.g., extraneous alarms, failed instruments, outside discussions).</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p></p>
  <p>This list was not meant to be exhaustive, but rather the minimum set of factors to consider in an HRA. While the list includes nearly double the number of PSFs as SPAR-H, treatment of the PSFs could easily be cross walked across most HRA methods. In the case of SPAR-H, for example, a single PSF covers multiple elements that are treated as separate PSFs in NUREG-1792.</p>
  <p>NUREG/CR-4862 (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0012" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>Ref. 12</a></span>) presents the cognitive environment simulation modeling tool that can be used to investigate what situations and factors lead to intention failures, what actions follow from intention failures (e.g., errors of omission, errors of commission), the ability to recover from errors or additional machine failures, and the effects of changes in the NPP person-machine system.</p>
  <p>Realizing that contextual nuances provide for an almost infinite number of possible PSFs, efforts have been undertaken to develop PSF categories that could frame broad influences while allowing more nuanced explorations within individual HRA methods. Groth and Mosleh<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>13</a></span></sup> reviewd available HRA databases to identify PSFs in use and developed a Bayesian Belief Network of the interactions between PSFs. The optimal number of categories to maintain orthogonality is five, as follows: (1) organizational factors related to training, corrective action, safety culture, and management activities; (2) team factors related to communications, direct supervision, team coordination, and team cohesion; (3) personal factors related to cognitive attention, physical and psychological abilities, morale and motivation, knowledge and experience, skills, familiarity, and biases; (4) situational factors related to external environment, hardware and software, conditioning events, task-specific factors, and decision making; and (5) machine design factors such as the HSI and system responses.</p>

 <h2 id="_i6" class="section-heading-2">III. TYPES OF HUMAN ERROR</h2>
 <p>Just as there are a multitude of PSFs to catalog the causes of errors, there are numerous ways of classifying the types of human error. For example, popular error taxonomies suggest that there are errors of omission and commission,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> reflecting actions skipped or done in addition to required tasks, respectively. Another taxonomy suggests an error may be considered a slip, lapse, mistake, or circumvention.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>14</a></span></sup> Errors may occur leading up to an event (pre initiators), causing the event (initiating events), or in responding to the event (post initiators).<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span></sup> Errors may be latent or active, meaning they have a delayed or immediate effect.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>14</a></span></sup> And errors may occur for all activities involving the nuclear facility, from the design, fabrication, and installation phases; to operations activities, involving control room and field operators; to emergency operations; to maintenance activities; to decommissioning.</p>
 <p>The cognitive basis of human errors described in Whaley et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>15</a></span></sup> anchors different causes and types of errors according to macro-cognitive functions. Macro-cognitive functions represent the basic processes of human mental activity, covering different stages: detecting and noticing, in which sensory information is taken into the human; sense making and understanding, in which this information is imbued with meaning; decision making, in which courses of action or inaction are determined; action, in which decisions are turned into behaviors; and teamwork, which complements the other stages by providing supplemental people to perform each stage and relay information between each other. Each macro-cognitive function presents unique opportunities for errors. For example, key information and cues may be missed by not being perceived, not being attended to, or being misperceived. This early-stage cognitive error affects subsequent stages and can lead to incorrect sense making and understanding, decision making, and actions. PSFs, such as the quality of the information or workload, set the context for detecting and noticing, and poor PSFs may prime an increased likelihood of error.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, human errors rarely rise to have significant consequences at plants. Plants are designed with redundancies such that no single-point failure leads to an accident. Likewise, human activities feature checks and balances, from second-checker personnel to catch errors, to procedure checks for correct performance of tasks, to hardware safety systems to prevent unintended effects of human errors. The purpose of AI tools to support operations is therefore not specifically to address safety concerns but rather to assist operators in day-to-day operations at the plant and to provide additional defense in depth during potential upset conditions. Artificial intelligence–based systems at NPPs foremost help ensure efficiency, ease of use, and reliability of operations. They may in some cases reinforce safety practices to provide even greater safety margins at NPPs.</p>

 <h2 id="_i7" class="section-heading-2">IV. MITIGATING HUMAN ERRORS USING AI</h2>
 <p>To reduce the consequences of human errors in NPPs, many efforts have been made to develop advanced operator support systems, such as decision support systems, sensor fault detection systems, operation validation systems, operator monitoring systems, autonomous control systems, predictive maintenance systems, automated text analysis systems, and safety assessment systems. Of particular interest is the use of AI technologies to ensure safe and reliable operation of a NPP. In this section, we examine the various AI-based methods that have been investigated in the literature to mitigate human errors in NPPs.</p>
 <div id="s0004-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i8">IV.A. Decision Support Systems</h3>
  <p>The use of smart support systems to assist operators’ decision-making ability has been widely researched in the past few decades. A well-designed decision support system must aid the cognitive process of operators and allow for convenient main control room (MCR) operation. This is particularly important during abnormal transient and process disturbances in NPPs where operators need to assess the current situations promptly and accurately. A typical alarm system in an MCR has a thousand or more alarms in addition to displays of analog data. In the event of an emergency, such as a loss-of-coolant accident or a feedwater line break, hundreds of alarms occur simultaneously. This causes information overload and stress on operators, severely affecting their decision-making ability.</p>
  <p>A fault diagnosis system is a type of decision support system whose objective is to make the task of fault diagnosis easier and reduce possibilities of human errors. Operators often need to perform high mental workload activities in the first few minutes after a fault occurrence. The information overload and time pressure under these emergency conditions cause stress, thereby severely affecting the operators’ decision-making ability when it is required the most. Fault diagnostic systems ease the workload of operators by quickly suggesting likely faults based on the probability of occurrence and provide accident-related information.</p>
  <p>Various methods based on AI have been proposed to build smart decision support systems for fault diagnostics (which include transient detection for many reactor conditions/states) and accident prediction in NPPs. The range of AI techniques studied spans from knowledge-based methods, such as expert systems, to more advanced and sophisticated data-driven algorithms such as ANNs, support vector machines (SVMs), and genetic algorithms.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016 cit0017 cit0018 cit0019 cit0020 cit0021 cit0022" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>16–22</a></span></sup></p>
  <p>Artificial neural networks have been one of the most popular AI modeling techniques for fault diagnostics and transient analysis in nuclear plants.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>16</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023 cit0024 cit0025 cit0026 cit0027 cit0028 cit0029 cit0030 cit0031" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23–31</a></span></sup> For instance, Mo et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>16</a></span></sup> and Lee et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23</a></span></sup> propose a fault diagnosis and advisory system based on dynamic neural networks, which are a type of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to enhance operators’ decision-making ability and reduce their mental workload. Mo et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>16</a></span></sup> use a two-level classifier architecture for fault diagnosis. The first level classifier recognizes the type of transient, and consequently, the second level classifier performs fault location detection and severity prediction, providing detailed accident information. Lee et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23</a></span></sup> improve upon this fault diagnostic system using two parallel neural networks, consisting of a modified dynamic neural network and a dynamic neuro-fuzzy network. The two networks perform independent fault diagnosis using different inputs to generate a more reliable output variable. Based on the diagnosis results, a computerized procedure search system selects an appropriate operating procedure necessary to manage the current situation so that operators’ omission errors can be considerably reduced.</p>
  <p>With the recent advances in neural network architecture and training procedures in the past decade, the effectiveness of deep learning–based models as a powerful feature extractor to perform high-accuracy prediction has come a long way. Many research works have explored the use of deep learning–based systems for the nuclear accident identification problem.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032 cit0033 cit0034 cit0035 cit0036" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>32–36</a></span></sup> Santos et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>32</a></span></sup> demonstrate the performance of a deep rectifier neural network that can identify many operational situations quickly and with high accuracy rates under reasonable training times. Zhang et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>33</a></span></sup> propose a modified long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, an improved version of the recurrent neural network, to identify abnormal or false pressurizer water levels (PWLs) in pressurized water reactors. Specifically, by modifying the loss function to include a cost-sensitive weighting factor, the LSTM model can overcome the issue of time-shifting correlations and example imbalance in PWL prediction. Such identification of the pressurizers’ real water levels can reduce the difficulty of the operation and reduce the probability of human errors. Yang and Kim<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0034" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>34</a></span></sup> develop an accident diagnosis algorithm using LSTM that allows for longer time dependencies in the input data to be modeled. Choi and Lee<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>35</a></span></sup> propose an automated diagnosis algorithm in emergency situations using a gated recurrent unit-decay model, an evolution over the LSTM model, to better handle missing data from faulty sensor measurements. Yang and Kim<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0036" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>36</a></span></sup> develop an accident diagnosis algorithm for the startup mode of NPPs wherein anomalies are harder to detect because of the several operation modes during startup.</p>
  <p>Accurate and rapid identification of fault status is of premier importance to reduce human error under pressure and to guarantee the safe and reliable operation of an NPP. The accuracy of neural network–based fault diagnosis methods is shown to improve by applying principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and noise filtering of the plant data in the prediagnostic stage.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>26</a></span></sup> To recognize malfunctions in a timely manner, Yu and Liu<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0024" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>24</a></span></sup> evaluate a real-time fault diagnosis method using a two-stage neural network architecture. The first ANN performs a rapid prediagnosis while the second ANN verifies the diagnosis and makes it more accurate. Using this two-stage neural network architecture, the method can not only diagnose the learned faults accurately with a low pretermission rate, but also identify unlearned faults under different operating conditions in real time. Ming et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup> study a similar two-step hybrid approach for fault diagnosis wherein first a multiflow model (MFM) localizes the fault, and then an ANN performs deep accurate diagnosis upon verifying the MFM result. The knowledge-based MFM method improves the understandability of diagnostic processes and results while the ANN enhances the success rate of identification.</p>
  <p>Many studies suggest AI approaches to diagnose potential accident scenarios; however, if an unknown (or untrained) accident scenario is presented, the performance of supervised approaches tends to deteriorate. To address these concerns, Yang et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>30</a></span></sup> develop an accident diagnosis algorithm including the “don’t know” response using LSTM neural networks and an auto encoder novelty detection function.

  <p>Besides ANNs, some studies have explored support vector–based models, namely SVM classifier and support vector regressor, for fault identification and detailed accident information.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>17</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0037 cit0038 cit0039" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>37–39</a></span></sup> Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, have also been reported to work robustly in terms of fault diagnosis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>18</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>19</a></span></sup></p>
  <p>Beyond accurate fault identification and diagnosis, ANNs have also been used in the context of diagnosis error and uncertainty estimation in nuclear plants.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>20</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>40</a></span></sup> The prediction error/uncertainty, estimated using an auxiliary neural network, allows plant operators to examine the credibility of the fault diagnosis and thereby make reliable decisions in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>While most research on decision support systems is based on modern machine learning algorithms, several intelligent operator support systems that adopted knowledge-based systems (KBSs) have been reported in the literature.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>21</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>29</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0041 cit0042 cit0043" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>41–43</a></span></sup> The most popular knowledge-based AI system is an expert system. An expert system is an AI program that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. Uhrig<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>21</a></span></sup> provides a survey of the different potential applications of expert systems in nuclear plants to reduce operator error and increase plant safety, reliability, and efficiency.

In this study, the ANN monitors the reactor’s safety status while the KBS module performs the fault diagnosis and procedure generation. Uhrig and Tsoukalas<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>29</a></span></sup> discuss the use of an expert system that has a neural network in its knowledge base, called a connectionist expert system, for identification of transients in NPPs that yielded great benefits in terms of speed, robustness, and knowledge acquisition. Further, they report the robust performance of hybrid neuro-fuzzy approaches that couple a rule-based expert system with pretrained ANNs using fuzzy logic in the presence of noise.</p>
  <p>Operator information/cognitive overload and lack of knowledge are major contributing factors to nuclear accidents. As such, expert support systems have the potential to reduce operator error in NPPs (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>Ref. 45</a></span>). For instance, Mampaey et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>46</a></span></sup> discuss the problem of operator stress and information overload that arise from using written procedures in post-accident situations and propose an expert system that can act as a truly dynamic task scheduler, rather than a conventional computerized procedure display to minimize operator omission errors in NPPs.</p>
  <p>Recent research by Hanna et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span></sup> demonstrates the use of a novel declarative AI approach, namely, Answer Set Programming, to represent the qualitative knowledge of the NPP in the form of logic rules. The represented knowledge is structured to form a reasoning-based operator support system and is shown to be capable of diagnosing faults, informing the operator of different scenarios and consequences, and generating recommended control actions.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i9">IV.B. Sensor Fault Detection Systems</h3>
  <p>Sensors are used to measure a range of parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow, fluid level, radiation) in NPPs and are one of the essential sources of data. Most automated and human-initiated decisions are based in whole or in part on these data, so it is important to ensure the reliability of the sensor and the accuracy of sensor readings. Incorrect sensor data could lead to incorrect decision making by humans or by automation systems. Human errors may also occur from operators misdiagnosing an accident and taking actions based on fault plant parameter measurements. Sensor failure detection is thus an extremely useful component of process control systems where an unchecked failure can be expensive and potentially dangerous.</p>
  <p>A study by Uhrig<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0047" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>47</a></span></sup> reports the use of probabilistic neural networks to diagnose instrument failures in NPPs. When a sensor begins to drift, the values predicted by the trained neural network and the observed plant parameters start to differ. By monitoring these deviations, a drift or instrumentation system failure can be identified.

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i10">IV.C. Operation Validation System</h3>
  <p>An operation validation system is an advisory system used to supervise and validate operator actions in NPPs. Operation validation systems provide two important functions for the operators: validating operator actions and performing an effects analysis of the proposed actions. By providing these functions to validate operator actions in the control panel, operator commission errors that may arise in high stress emergency situations can be effectively reduced.</p>
  <p>Neural networks have been used to model the effects analysis of operator actions and reduce the error of commission in NPPs (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>Refs. 23</a></span>, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0055" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>55</a></span> through <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>58</a></span>).

The system provides both qualitative and quantitative effects analysis of operator actions. Based on the predictions, suggestions/warnings are provided to operators to mitigate human errors during operation in emergency scenarios. Operators can examine the possible outcomes of their expected actions and accordingly choose to confirm or cancel their actions. Similarly, Bae et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0058" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>58</a></span></sup> propose a recursive strategy that employs an ANN as its prediction model to predict the future trends of important plant parameters to determine whether a performed action is an error or not. In this study, two types of ANNs, namely, MLP and LSTM networks, are compared against their usefulness in detecting and recovering human errors in emergency situations in NPPs. It is observed that the future trends of plant parameters are quite accurately predicted through the LSTM model. Ahn et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>56</a></span></sup> suggest an unsafe acts detection system based on colored petri nets (CPNs) and deep neural networks to determine if an operator action is an error and discover its effect on the plant integrity. The proposed system reduces human error in the MCR by reducing the mental workload and enhancing the operators’ situational awareness.</p>
  <p>Ahn and Lee<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0057" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>57</a></span></sup> propose a procedural compliance check (PCC) system based on CPN modeling and neural networks. The CPN model converts the NPP emergency operating procedures to modeling language and is used in situations where no decisions or only simple decisions are needed. In situations where it is difficult to implement rule-based answers, such as continuous observation of changes in the trends of a parameter, a deep learning algorithm is employed to assist with complex decision making. A procedure incompliance is judged when an operator action is inconsistent with the response planning as predicted by the system. The PCC system proposed can help reduce procedural violations and human error, and therefore reduce the human error probability in emergency operating situations.</p>

The important bio-signal markers of FFD are selected based on a multivariate analysis of variance and are fed to a multiclass and binary-class SVM classifier to achieve fast identification of a potential at-risk worker.

NLP technology can enable the automatic assessment of an operator’s situational awareness and mental workload through oral assessments. NLP simplifies the measurement process by reducing the workload and interruption caused by traditional survey-based cognitive measures. Moreover, through automated extraction of rich, semantic knowledge from the record of different events during the operation and maintenance in NPPs, NLP can aid in understanding complex team processes (e.g., team cognition). The insights gained therein can improve the team’s situational awareness and reduce their mental workload. Computer vision-based human tracking can be used to detect the anomalous behavior of field workers in NPPs, which in turn can help anticipate and avoid accidents.

However, performing such routine preventive and corrective maintenance can significantly increase operating expenses. Performing corrective and predictive maintenance of NPP systems, structures, and components can alleviate this problem.</p>
  <p>A deviation from normal operating circumstances can be caused by a single component failure or several faults in many components. It can be difficult for an operator to detect such problems and locate the problematic equipment in a timely manner, especially if the problem develops slowly.

Furthermore, such systems can assist in comprehending dynamic team processes, like team cognition during outages, providing insights and information on complex team skills to increase team situational awareness and minimize mental fatigue and even identify optimal interventions.</p>
  <p>A preliminary study by Zhao et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0093" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>93</a></span></sup> investigates the feasibility and provides the basis for developing an automated tool for analyzing text-based event reports. The study aims at identifying causal relationships between events described in the report in the NRC Licensee Event Report (LER) database. To this end, a list of keywords that indicate causal relationships is first identified from examining a set of sample reports. These keywords are then considered together with part of speech tagging and dependency parsing of a sentence using state-of-the-art NLP techniques to identify the causal and consequent events in the sentence. In a related work, Zhao et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0094" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>94</a></span></sup> propose the use of a rule-based expert system that can identify over 86% of the causal relationships in the test data automatically.

By integrating text mining for the measurement of organizational factors and PRAs, useful features are extracted from unstructured free text data and an SVM classifier is used to estimate the probability of having “training deficiency” as one of the causes of reported events.

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i15">IV.H. Safety Assessment</h3>
  <p>When designing a NPP, stringent design requirements are imposed to ensure that all components can withstand abnormal operating conditions. Severe weather, seismic activity, or extreme heat and pressure may occur as a result of an accident at the facility. This method of designing a plant and its components that includes requirements and safety margins to account for anticipated abnormal conditions is called deterministic safety analysis. Starting in the 1980s, PRAs (also called probabilistic safety assessment) was established as a way to calculate the risk that arises from the interplay of equipment failure and human error. PRA models analyze the overall risk to a nuclear power station under abnormal conditions using probabilities. PRAs assist operators in gaining a better understanding of each NPP and identifying areas where safety can be improved.</p>
  <p>Kim and Seong<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0096" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>96</a></span></sup> develop a new safety evaluation methodology for NPPs by adopting the concept of an early warning score from the medical field. The proposed methodology overcomes the challenges in existing methodologies, such as PRAs or safety performance indicators, by handling cases that are not included in the model and enables real-time safety evaluation.</p>
  <p>Abrishami et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0097" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>97</a></span></sup> study the use of Bayesian networks to improve the performance of Success Likelihood Index Models (SLIMs), one of the widely used deterministic techniques in HRA to handle uncertainty arising from experts’ opinions and insufficient data. The proposed BN-SLIM model considers uncertainty associated with the rates of PSFs using probability distributions and can provide a better estimation of human error probability by considering conditional dependencies resulting from common PSFs. The probability updating feature of the BN-SLIM can be used to determine which PSFs are most responsible for human failure events. To obtain more accurate and realistic results of PRAs, it is necessary to reflect more complete dynamics of NPPs. Kim et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0098" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>98</a></span></sup> propose a fast-running model using deep learning techniques to obtain plausible accident scenarios while reducing the resources required to conduct a full PRA.

 <h2 id="_i16" class="section-heading-2">V. DISCUSSION</h2>
 <p>Several studies performed over the years indicate that the occurrence of human error is an important factor in NPP safety-related incidents and effective operations and maintenance. Many traditional decision-making systems and data intelligence functions based on static models and algorithms have been developed to aid operators’ cognitive activities. Although such systems have made great progress, they are often limited in their impact when dealing with complex decision-making environments and the rapidly increasing volume and complexity of data.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0099" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>99</a></span></sup> For instance, Hsieh et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0100" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>100</a></span></sup> develop a decision support system based on a deterministic computer program and a database for abnormal operating environments in NPPs. However, the system state combination created by dynamic and complicated parameter changes can quickly make the size of this database impractical to manage and eventually lead to unpredictable system states and faults.</p>
 <p>Although the concept of automated control systems in NPPs has been around for decades, the degree of automation in safety functions is still low, and operator intervention remains a crucial part of the control system. Extensions to traditional PID-based automated and anticipatory control strategies have been proposed to advance the operation of NPPs and reduce the reliance on human actions.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0082" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>82</a></span></sup> However, an effective fully autonomous system is still far from practical implementation in the nuclear industry. Moreover, insufficient automation also exists in other aspects apart from safety functions, such as power control, where traditional control methods are dominant.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0101" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>101</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>As described in the previous section, AI technology can overcome many of these challenges of traditional operator support systems. The infusion of AI in direct support systems, such as intelligent advisors, alarm systems, fault diagnostic systems, and operation validation systems, can aid plant operators in situation assessment and response planning and implementation. Artificial intelligence–powered fitness monitoring systems that continuously track worker wellbeing and safety assessment systems are crucial to building a safe environment. Predictive maintenance systems and sensor fault detection systems are required to monitor and detect emergent problems early on to ensure the operational safety and performance improvement of NPPs. Automated text analysis systems that extract rich semantic information from the event reports during the operation and maintenance of NPPs yield useful information for enhancing NPP operation and safety. <a href="#f0001">Figure 1</a> summarizes the different smart support systems discussed in the literature and the various AI technologies used therein.</p>

 <p>Artificial intelligence–based systems also have their limitations. While recent years have seen significant advances in AI technologies, there has been growing discussion about the scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness of these AI technologies, and why a particular decision was reached.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0102" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>102</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0103" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>103</a></span></sup> Starter and Billings<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0104" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>104</a></span></sup> explain how autonomous systems may sometimes create surprises for operators when they confront unpredictable and difficult-to-understand system behavior in the context of ongoing operations. Building explainable AI systems is of paramount importance, especially for mission-critical applications such as NPP outage management. Further, the performance of any AI system depends heavily on the data used to train and evaluate the system. With the information security and protection measures of NPPs still in their infancy,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0105" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>105</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0106" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>106</a></span></sup> one needs to be wary of new threats and challenges to data and cybersecurity. For instance, the electrical systems in NPPs in use today lack effective protection measures and their information security protection capabilities are weak.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0106" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>106</a></span></sup> It is also worth noting that the inferences drawn from previous studies about the usefulness of AI technology in reducing human errors are based on controlled experiments or nuclear event simulations and their practical implementation in NPPs is yet to be achieved.</p>
 <p>While AI-enabled digital systems have the capability to enhance plant automation and automate error-prone and tedious activities, plant designers must decide what to automate and how to integrate operator interaction with automation to utilize these systems to their fullest potential. Novel approaches are thus needed to optimize the overall plant performance by allocating functions between operators and autonomous systems based on their strengths and weaknesses and designing HSIs that support human-automation interaction.</p>
 <p>The interactions between human and autonomous systems are crucial to the plant system’s performance and reliability. Several human factors–related issues regarding the human-autonomous system interaction have been addressed in the literature.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0087" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>87</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0104" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>104</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0107" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>107</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0108" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>108</a></span></sup> Starter and Billings<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0104" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>104</a></span></sup> describe how a considerable number of unanticipated problems and failures are related for the most part to breakdowns in the interaction between human operators and automated systems and explain the principles and benefits of a human-centered rather than a technology-centered approach to the design of automated systems. O’Hara<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0107" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>107</a></span></sup> presents guidelines for the design of interfaces that enhance the ability of operators to monitor and supervise automation and facilitate greater cooperation between human and autonomous agents. O’Hara<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0107" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>107</a></span></sup> also describes a qualitative methodology that can be used to allocate functions to automatic systems, plant operators, or to some combination of the two based on the relative role of humans and automation. Similarly, O’Hara and Higgins<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0109" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>109</a></span></sup> develop a general guideline for human-automation interactions. Kim and Park<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0110" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>110</a></span></sup> list considerations for designing HSIs using previous research of human-computer interactions or human-robot interactions. Specifically, they consider task allocation and the five attributes of human-automation interactions to optimize the performance of the joint human-automation system based on Goodrich and Schultz,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0111" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>111</a></span></sup> namely, autonomy and interaction, information exchanges, team structure, adaptation, learning and training, and shape of the task.</p>
 <p>Kim et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0087" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>87</a></span></sup> discuss human-autonomous system interaction as one of the key design features of an advanced support system and describe three key human factors issues: (1) out-of-the-loop (OOTL) unfamiliarity wherein a lack of understanding of autonomous behavior can result in difficulties for human operators when they take over control of the operation, (2) the tendency of designers to create multimodal systems that possess increased complexity and longer time constant feedback loops, and (3) the critical decision authority, especially in relation to safety, assigned to autonomous systems. Kaber and Endsley<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0112" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>112</a></span></sup> also discuss the critical issue of OOTL performance in fully autonomous systems. Operators of highly automated systems are often separated from direct, real-time control of the system, whether it is determining if process control intervention is required, noticing a critical system event, or approving or rejecting the actions of an automated control system. OOTL performance is associated with many negative consequences, such as reduced vigilance (operator failure to observe system changes), complacency (human over-trust in computers), loss of situation awareness (because of poor system observability), and operator skill decay. These consequences have been found to impact human performance under both normal and abnormal operating conditions, with a greater effect on the latter.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0113" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>113</a></span></sup> This causes major problems with operators’ capacity to perform their role when working together with autonomous systems. Kaber and Endsley<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0112" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>112</a></span></sup> present a level of automation taxonomy to ameliorate OOTL performance problems. Using this framework, they identify optimal combinations of human and computer control of various system functions, such as monitoring, planning, and option selection and implementation, that produce improvements in system performance under intermediate levels. Results on its utility in a dynamic control task indicated decreases in the number of system processes/tasks overlooked by operators. These enhancements are expected to be relevant to general process control systems and could result in cost savings due to increased operational safety.</p>
 <p>Traditional computer-based procedures and AI-powered portable devices can also play a key role in improving the plant work management process, thereby increasing operator productivity and decreasing cost. Rashdan et al.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0114" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>114</a></span></sup> and Rashdan and Agarwal<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0115" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>115</a></span></sup> propose an automated work package (AWP) technology to improve the plant work management process in a manner that increases efficiency while reducing human error. AWP uses plant condition, resources status, and user progress to adaptively drive the work process using the information acquired from various systems of a NPP and incorporates several advanced instrumentation and control technologies along with modern human factors techniques.</p>
 <p>Beyond building smart operator support systems, AI technology can also be leveraged to build improved indirect operator support systems. These include intelligent HSIs that support rich interactions, advanced display systems and information systems to improve the operators’ perceptions and awareness abilities for monitoring and detection activities.</p>
 <p>There is also vast potential for cross knowledge transfer from other sectors and industries, including oil and gas, healthcare, aviation, and manufacturing industries, that have adopted and implemented AI technologies to mitigate human errors. Particularly, in the case of the healthcare industry, AI helps in detecting and mitigating preventable medical errors. The most common and costly types of measurable or preventable medical errors in the United States in 2008 were postoperative infection ($3.4 billion); pressure ulcer ($3.3 billion); a mechanical complication of noncardiac device, implant, or graft ($1.1 billion); and post-laminectomy syndrome ($1 billion), accounting for almost half of all estimated medical error–associated costs that year.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0116" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>116</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0117" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>117</a></span></sup> To combat these, AI-based support systems could help physicians decide what treatment to provide patients, taking into account vast amounts of data and finding patterns that doctors might normally miss, especially in high-stress environments. Some of the AI models that are already in practice include hospital computerized physician order entry for medication ordering errors,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0118" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>118</a></span></sup> image analysis in radiology and dermatology, and deep learning histopathology for identifying metastatic breast cancer.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0119" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>119</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Another industry where machine learning methodologies are proving to be useful is the aviation industry. Human errors are recognized to be the primary or secondary cause of most residual accidents or incidents in the aviation industry.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0120" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>120</a></span></sup> Errors like a controlled flight into terrain and loss of control remain the predominant causes of loss of life in aviation worldwide, making humans one of the weak links in aircraft safety.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0121" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>121</a></span></sup> Here, AI proves to be useful in mitigating errors. The already useful applications in practice can be seen in augmenting drone technology for flight accuracy, building smart cockpits for safety, and intelligent maintenance schedules to detect and track possible faults.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0122" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>122</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Despite existing challenges, AI has immense potential to speed technological development in nuclear fields by seizing opportunities and borrowing ideas from different sectors and industries. As mentioned by Mikhail Chudakov, International Atomic Energy Agency Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy:</p>
 <div class="quote">
  <p>In order to be competitive, as well as integrated into the mix of modern energy systems, nuclear power plants – in addition to being safe, secure and reliable – also need to be economical and efficient.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0123" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>123</a></span></sup></p>
 </div>
 <p></p>
 <p>Although almost all subsectors of the nuclear energy industry have implementations of AI, there still remains the need for standardization and cooperation. Accepting a set of internationally acceptable standards enables even wider adoption of AI with the potential of developing from the current standards. Given that AI depends on data availability and quality, as more curated data are available, it will be easier for algorithms to identify patterns in certain phenomena and thus make better predictions. Therefore, international cooperation to obtain, develop, maintain, and analyze global data with the help of AI in various nuclear fields is key to accelerating technological development and realizing the full potential of AI (Ref. 123). Along with this, collaboration across different disciplines to establish common knowledge-sharing platforms to coordinate and support partnerships between cross-domain researchers for the development of guidelines related to regulations, education, and training in AI will enable researchers from around the world to share experience, knowledge, and good practices.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0123" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>123</a></span></sup></p>

 <h2 id="_i18" class="section-heading-2">VI. CONCLUSION</h2>
 <p>Human errors have been identified as the major cause of safety-related incidents in the nuclear industry. Although some NPPs have been digitized after decades of use, many NPPs still use traditional operation and control methods, decreasing the operational performance and increasing the risk of accidents. Developing advanced operator support systems that leverage the latest advancements in AI technology can enhance operations, potentially leading to additional benefits for overall plant safety and reliability. This critical review provides a deep insight via literature review and critical analysis into the potential of AI technology to mitigate human errors and their consequences in NPPs. While the incidence of human errors leading to events at NPPs is rare, the advent of AI technology increases the safety margin on plants and paves the way to introduce AI-based concepts of operation into future plants.</p>
 <p>The causes for human error occurrences in NPP activities are introduced and their classification is provided. A thorough review of the different types of operator support systems, namely, decision support systems, sensor fault detection systems, operation validation systems, operator monitoring systems, autonomous control systems, autonomous control systems, predictive maintenance systems, automated text analysis systems, and safety assessment systems, and how researchers have integrated AI technologies into NPPs is presented. Through the various research studies, the application of AI technologies to assist plant operators in diagnosing faults quicker and making mission-critical decisions for continued safe operation of the plant is discussed. Such intelligent operator support systems will pave the way for the safe, economic, reliable, and efficient operation of NPPs in years to come.</p>
