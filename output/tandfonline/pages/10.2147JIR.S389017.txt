 <p>Renal impairment may take the form of acute or chronic. Epidemiological studies show that drug-induced nephrotoxicity is the third most common cause of acute kidney disease,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1</a></span></sup> and it is one of the major contributing factors to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>The pivotal roles of the kidney including the secretion, reabsorption, filtration, bioactivation, and excretion of most of the substances that enter the biological system, render it to be a good target for many medications to induce their toxicity. The increased and sustained exposure to numerous medicines and drug metabolites can cause harm to the functional unit of the kidney, including the vascular element, tubules, and the glomeruli.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>3</a></span></sup> 5-FU, the uracil nucleotide analog, is one of the cytotoxic medications used in various types of cancers such as stomach, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers in addition to cervical and breast cancer.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>4</a></span></sup> The toxicities of 5-FU appear in several organs such as the kidney,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>5</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span></sup> liver,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span></sup> CNS,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> and the heart.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> Many mechanisms have been proposed for the nephrotoxic effect of 5-FU; DNA damage and nontargeting apoptotic cell death via increasing caspase-3 activity in the kidneys are the most deleterious effect of 5-FU.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>10</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span></sup> Additionally, attenuating the kidney’s ability to scavenge and neutralize free radicals, particularly ROS, predisposes it to different types of oxidative stress assaults, which play a key role in triggering 5-FU-induced renal damage.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0012" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>12</a></span></sup> Furthermore, triggering inflammatory response is another proposed mechanism of 5-FU-induced nephrotoxicity because it has been shown to increase activities of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 in the organs of rats treated with 5-FU.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>10</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>The local effect of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has taken pronounced attention, since the components of this system have been found in various tissues, suggesting their role in cellular growth and differentiation.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>13</a></span></sup> Prorenin uptake and intrarenal activation of the kidney RAS is thought to be the cause of renal injury and microvascular alterations in the kidney.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>14</a></span></sup> Angiotensin II may cause pressure-induced renal injury via its ability to induce systemic and glomerular hypertension or cause ischemia-induced renal injury secondary to intrarenal vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>15</a></span></sup> Targeting this system is one of the strategies for protecting renal damage.

 <p>Combining ARBs with natural products like curcumin and resveratrol has been proven to be more successful in lowering metabolic disturbances, inflammation, insulin resistance (IR), hypertension, and a variety of other diabetic problems.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>19</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>20</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Flavonoids found in medicinal plants, vegetables, and fruits have the potential to be a novel medication source. In this regard, quercetin (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is a well-known flavonoid with antihypertensive<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>21</a></span></sup> and renoprotective properties.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span></sup> Adjuvant use of quercetin with other medications like sitagliptin has proven to exert cardioprotective effects<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23</a></span></sup> and protect against testicular damage induced by doxorubicin.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0024" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>24</a></span></sup> Another study showed that the concomitant use of quercetin with valsartan was effective in enhancing intestinal absorption and attenuating valsartan outflow.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup> All these effects, together with the approved regulatory effect on RAS offered by quercetin,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>26</a></span></sup> suggest the use of quercetin with a drug like telmisartan for the possible synergistic renoprotective effects induced by 5-FU.

 <div id="s0002-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i10">Experimental Animals</h3>
  <p>Male Wistar albino rats weighing 150–230 g were purchased from the animal house of the University of Tikrit. The rats were kept in the animal house of the College of Pharmacy/University of Sulaimani in a well-ventilated plastic cage, in normal conditions (temperature 25±2°C) and light–dark cycles. They were fed a standard pellet diet and had free access to water. The rats were acclimatized for 2 weeks before the beginning of the experiment. The experimental protocols met the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation and were approved by the ethical committee of the University of Sulaimani (Certificate no.6 on the date 14/11/2021) following the institutional Animal Ethics Committee. The study was performed by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0002-s2002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">Study Design</h3>
  <p>Forty fully-grown adult male rats were randomly divided into five groups, comprising eight animals each as follows:</p>
  <p>Group 1: The negative control group received only 1 mL distilled water (D.W) by oral gavage for 14 days.</p>
  <p>Group 2: The positive control group received 1 mL D.W by oral gavage for 14 days and a single intraperitoneal injection of 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg) on the 13th day of the experiment.</p>
  <p>Group 3: The Telmisartan group received telmisartan (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 14 days with the protocol of 5-FU on the 13th day of the experiment.</p>
  <p>Group 4: The Quercetin group received quercetin (80 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 14 days with the protocol of 5-FU on the 13th day of the experiment.</p>
  <p>Group 5: The combination group received both telmisartan (10 mg/kg) and quercetin (80 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 14 days with the protocol of 5-FU on the 13th day of the experiment.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i12">Measurement of the Weight and Relative Organ Weight of the Rats</h4>
   <p>The rats utilized in the experiment were weighed before starting the treatment and on scarification day, using a weight measurement scale. The kidneys were removed carefully, cleaned of all other tissue, and weighed. Relative organ weight was measured using the following equation:</p>
   <p>Relative organ weight = Organ weight (g) x [1,000/Body weight (g)].</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i13">Tissue Homogenization and Blood Sample Collection</h4>
   <p>On the 15th day of the experiment the animals were anesthetized using chloroform. After euthanizing the animals, approximately 5 mL of blood was collected by cardiac puncture, the blood was placed in a tube and allowed to clot, then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes and the separated serum directly went through laboratory testing.</p>
   <p>Both kidneys were harvested: one of the kidneys was washed with ice-cold normal saline and put in 25 mL of 10% formaldehyde for later histopathological examination. The other kidney was removed and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline PBS solution, then the whole kidney was weighed, dissected, and homogenized with every 1 g of the kidney, 9 mL of PBS was added according to the instruction from bioassay technology Elisa kits, homogenization was done with an homogenizer machine. The homogenized samples were immediately centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 min in a cold centrifuge and the supernatant fluids were collected and stored at −80°C for later kidney biomarker analysis.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i17">Histopathological Protocol</h3>
  <p>Initially, animals were euthanized in a humane practice, continuously, after animal sacrificing necropsy started by collecting tissue samples for histological preparation. Briefly, kidney samples were cut and immobilized into tissue cassettes and then fixed with 10% buffered formaldehyde solution for about 48 hours. Afterward, the sections were dehydrated by passing through a series of ascending concentrations of ethanol alcohol (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%), followed by three phases of xylene clearance. Next, the processed kidney tissues were impregnated and embedded in melted paraffin casts using an automated wax embedder. Paraffinized tissues were sectioned to 6 µm using a semi-automated rotary microtome. Then after, tissue sections were fixed on glass slides and dried using a hot plate tissue holder. Later on, glass slides with their mounted tissue sections were deparaffinized and cleaned with two xylene changes then dried in a hot oven at 50°C for 15 minutes. Finally, tissue sections were stained with Harris’s hematoxylin and eosin solution, cleaned with xylene and cover slipped, then viewed under a bright field light microscope.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i18">Quantitative Lesion Scoring</h4>
   <p>Lesion scoring was evaluated quantitatively via image analyzer software (AmScope, 3.7) using an ocular lens camera (MD500, 2019) fixed with a bright field light microscope (NOVEL XSZ-N107T, China). In kidney sections, renal tubular cellular degeneration was estimated and measured in the percentage of calculated cell numbers from randomly selected different fields, whereas vascular congestion was assessed in micrometers and statistically evaluated as the mean percentage. While inflammatory cells were counted in 10 randomly chosen fields under high power magnification (100X), the mean average was calculated statistically as a percentage. Lastly, necrotic cells with their pyknotic nuclei were counted from randomly selected fields, then evaluated as the calculated average mean percentage. In conclusion, the mean percentage of all calculated values was expressed as following the lesion scoring-grading system (score 0–10% as no lesions; score 10–25% as mild; score 25–50% as moderate; score 50–75% as severe; score 75–100 as critical).<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>30</a></span></sup></p>

  <p>The use of 5-FU produced a significant increase in the level of KIM-1 in comparison with the negative control group (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). All the treatment groups including telmisartan, quercetin alone, and in combination were able to produce a significant reduction in the KIM-1 value in the kidneys tissue when compared to the positive control group (<i>p</i>=0.0034, 0.0066, and 0.0004, respectively) (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4A</a>). Concerning NGAL level; 5-FU produced a significant increase when compared with the negative control group (<i>p</i>=0.01). Meanwhile, a significant decrease has been observed with telmisartan (<i>p</i>=0.008) and quercetin (<i>p</i>0.009), with a significant reduction in the combination group when compared to the positive control group (<i>p</i>=0.006) (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4B</a>). The tissue level of cystatin-C has increased significantly in the positive control group when compared to the negative control group (<i>p</i>=0.0001). Telmisartan alone decreased the level of Cys-C significantly (<i>p</i>=0.0022). Quercetin alone and the combination group were also able to decrease its level significantly (<i>p</i>=0.0009, and 0.0002, respectively) (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4C</a>). Regarding TAOC level in the tissue, a significant decline in its level has been achieved by the use of 5-FU when compared to the negative control group (<i>p</i>=0.046). Only the combination group was able to increase the level of TAOC significantly (<i>p</i>=0.047) (<a href="#f0004">Figure 4D</a>).</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the quantitative morphometric assay and lesion scoring of kidney sections are illustrated in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="t0001">Table 1</button>. Interestingly, animals in treatment group 5 (G5) which is a combination of telmisartan 10 mg/kg and quercetin 80 mg/kg, show enormous improvement in the abnormal morphological changes induced by a single dose of 5-FU 150 mg/kg, which is evident by a significant (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) reduction in the percentage of acute cellular swelling (hydropic degeneration) within the renal tubular epithelia, as well as remarkable mitigation in the number of necrotic cells, along with the number of inflammatory cells (<a href="#f0005">Figure 5</a>). Moreover, tissue sections from animals treated with telmisartan 10 mg/kg (G3) and quercetin 80 mg/kg (G4) alone show significant alleviation in lesion scoring in comparison with the positive control group G2 (5-FU 150 mg/kg a single dose) apparent by a clear reduction in the number of degenerative and necrotic cells as well as vascular disorders.</p>

 <p>Inflammatory reaction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage and the condition is known as nephritis. An intricate web of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and local immune cells, such macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as the enlistment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, constitutes inflammation, a condition closely related to renal illness.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>44</a></span></sup> Monocytes are crucial for tissue remodeling, inflammation, and innate and adaptive immunity.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>45</a></span></sup> Potential substitute indicators for inflammation include neutrophils and lymphocytes.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i34 _i35" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>46</a></span></sup> The results of the current study clearly revealed significant elevation in the levels of CRP, NLR, MLR, and PLR in the 5-FU treated group.

 <h2 id="_i32" class="section-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>The results of the current study strongly demonstrate the renoprotective effects of the combination of telmisartan and quercetin against the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU via attenuating the levels of kidney damage specific markers such as KIM-1, NGAL, and cystatin C, and the novel inflammatory markers of kidney injury like NLR, MLR, and PLR as well as restoring total antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, the combination therapy also ameliorated tissue degeneration and lesion scoring in the histopathological finding. The proposed mechanism could be the additive inhibitory effect on RAS provided by both telmisartan and quercetin. These finding suggest the use of this combination as add-on therapy with 5-FU to minimize the toxic effects afforded by the later one.</p>
