 <h2 id="_i6" class="section-heading-2">Plain Language Summary</h2>
 <p>In the corneal clinic of a university hospital in a metropolitan area, we sometimes encounter referred patients with severe corneal ulcers who have been treated with topical corticosteroids as well as antibiotic eye drops. Why were these topical corticosteroids prescribed? We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of patients with infectious keratitis treated with topical corticosteroids before a culture-proven diagnosis. During an investigative period of 4 years, 14 eyes of 14 patients were evaluated. All the patients were prescribed topical corticosteroids for the keratitis owing to unresponsive empirical antibiotic therapy, and at least six patients were treated for stromal keratitis due to herpes simplex virus.</p>
 <p>Why did the corneal lesions of these patients worsen? Based on culture results, we diagnosed <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis in six patients and fungal keratitis in two patients. Apart from bacterial keratitis, other microorganisms responsible for keratitis do not respond to antibiotic therapy, and the condition is worsened by the topical corticosteroids without appropriate anti-amoebic or anti-fungal therapy.</p>
 <p>Application of topical corticosteroids for keratitis without microbiological evidence is harmful, and a differential diagnosis of herpetic stromal keratitis as well as fungal and <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis is needed when using topical corticosteroid for the treatment of suspected infectious keratitis.</p>

 <p>At the corneal clinic of our institution and hospital in a metropolitan area, which serves a population of 4 million, we sometimes encounter referred patients with severe corneal ulcers who have been treated with topical corticosteroids. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical features and the visual outcomes of these patients, and to elucidate the effect of the empirical use of topical corticosteroids on the clinical course of this condition and the background of steroid applications in such patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="s0003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_1">
 <h2 id="_i8" class="section-heading-2">Patients and Methods</h2>
 <p>We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who visited the Cornea Service at Fujita Health University Bantane Hospital and were treated for infectious keratitis from April 2016 to March 2020. The diagnosis of microbial infectious keratitis was confirmed by culture, but because the antibiotic therapy had already been started before the patients arrived at our institution, many of them were solely diagnosed based on the corneal findings and the clinical course.</p>
 <p>Suspected infectious keratitis patients treated with topical corticosteroids before culture-proven diagnosis were retrospectively studied in terms of demographics, best-corrected visual acuity at arrival and at the last visit, clinical course after the initial visit, ocular history, and combination therapy by the previous ophthalmologist. We used this information to determine the influence of topical steroid therapy and to determine the factors that led to the steroid prescription.</p>
 <p>This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Fujita Health University Faculty of Medicine (Approval number: C120-135). Informed consent was obtained from each patient for use in clinical records for future research.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i10">Patients’ Visits</h3>
  <p>Two hundred eyes of 197 patients were treated for microbial infectious keratitis in the investigation period. Among the 197 patients, 195 eyes of 192 patients were referred from a hospital or ophthalmic clinic. Almost all the referred patients had already been empirically treated with topical or systemic antibiotic therapy, and the reason for the referral was a poor response to the antibiotic therapy.</p>
  <p>Among the referred patients, 14 eyes of 14 patients had been treated with corticosteroid eye drops before arrival (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>).</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">Use of Topical Corticosteroids</h3>
  <p>Corticosteroid eye drops were not used before keratitis occurred but were used to treat the corneal lesions. Out of the 14 patients, six patients were prescribed topical corticosteroids by the referring doctor, and eight patients were prescribed these drugs by another doctor (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>). The details of the medical practice, other than the referring doctor, at the previous doctor’s clinic were unknown, but the prescribed corticosteroid eye drops were 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate for nine patients, 0.1% fluorometholone for two patients, and unknown steroid eye drops for three patients. Among the nine patients who were treated with 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate, combined corticosteroid-antibiotic eye drops (betamethasone sodium sulfate/fradiomycin sulfate) were prescribed for at least three patients (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>).</p>
  <p>All patients visited the ophthalmic clinic with a complaint of ocular pain, red eye, and visual disturbance. Nine patients were contact lens wearers (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>).</p>

  <p>The history of herpetic keratitis and treatment is described in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>. According to the referral letters, four patients (cases 4, 5, 8, and 14) had a past history of herpetic keratitis, but the details and the accuracy of the diagnosis were unknown. At least six of the 14 patients were treated with either acyclovir ocular ointment or valaciclovir tablets, along with topical corticosteroids (cases 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14). Although we could not exclude concurrent herpetic stromal keratitis because our institution did not have the facility to perform either the immune chromatography or the real-time polymerase chain reaction, the corneal findings and the clinical course of the patients’ eyes were not suggestive of herpetic necrotic keratitis.</p>

 <div id="s0004-s2004" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i13">Culture and Diagnosis</h3>
  <p>Corneal scraping and culture were performed for 13 patients (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>); however, because the cornea was already perforated and <i>Acanthamoeba</i> was proven by the referral doctor, culture was not performed for case 8. As listed in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>, based on the results of the cultures, we diagnosed keratitis as follows: bacterial keratitis in two patients including one suspected case, <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis in six patients, fungal keratitis in two patients, and unknown cause in four patients. Case 2 had a corneal ulcer with a 3.0-mm diameter and hypopyon at the first visit, but the inflammation subsided within 3 weeks of topical antibiotic therapy, and we thus diagnosed the patient with bacterial keratitis even though the culture was negative. In four patients with unknown causes (cases 11−14), the diagnosis of microbial infectious keratitis was made from the clinical presentation at the first visit (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>), but it was not possible to determine whether these were bacterial, fungal, or <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis cases based on the clinical course.</p>

  <p>The prognosis is summarized in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>. The patients with bacterial keratitis (cases 1 and 2) responded well to the topical antibiotic therapy, and the corneal lesion healed as a scar after 3 weeks, after which corticosteroid eye drops were started again to settle the infiltration.</p>
  <p>The prognosis for the vision of the two patients with <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis (cases 5 and 8) whose anti-amoebic therapy was started more than 10 weeks after the onset was poor (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>). In patients with <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis in whom appropriate anti-amoebic therapy was started at least within 2 weeks from the onset, the visual prognosis was good, even though topical corticosteroids were applied before the diagnosis (cases 3, 6, and 7).</p>
  <p>Both patients with fungal keratitis visited the specialist clinic 3 weeks after the onset of the complaint (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>). The delay in the diagnosis and identification of the causative organism (<i>Fusarium</i> species), in addition to the use of topical corticosteroid before diagnosis, may have caused a corneal perforation and loss of sight in the affected eyes (cases 9 and 10).</p>
  <p>In the five culture-negative cases, we could not determine the causative microorganism based on the corneal appearance and the clinical course in four cases (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>). Favorable recovery of vision has still not been obtained in two of the cases (cases 13 and 14). This may be due to the difficulty in establishing a treatment plan because the empirical topical antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment has masked the appearance of the corneal lesion.</p>

 <p>Similar to the findings of the SCUT study, in our cases, the use of topical steroids along with antibiotics did not affect the vision prognoses in the eyes with bacterial keratitis; however, vision was lost in two eyes with fungal keratitis (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>). Even though this poor outcome may be attributed to the <i>Fusarium</i> sp. that was involved in two of our cases, topical corticosteroids should not be used for fungal keratitis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>18</a></span></sup> For the eyes with <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis, topical corticosteroids are not contraindicated as long as appropriate anti-amoebic therapy is applied.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>19</a></span></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>21</a></span></sup> However, two of the six <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis eyes lost vision in our study (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>). In the <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis patients (cases 5 and 8) as well as in two fungal keratitis patients (cases 9 and 10) and two unknown keratitis patients (cases 13 and 14), one of the reasons for the undesirable visual prognosis could be the delay in proper diagnosis (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>), caused by the masked clinical findings (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>) and the reactions to the empirical use of topical antibiotics and corticosteroids.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>26</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>From the referral letter information, at least eight patients were assumed to be treated with topical corticosteroids after being diagnosed with stromal herpetic keratitis. Three of the six <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis patients, one of the two fungal keratitis patients, and two of the four unknown keratitis patients were treated with acyclovir ointment or valaciclovir tablets (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>). In addition to these patients who were treated with anti-herpes virus drugs, two <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis patients had a history of herpetic keratitis, according to the referral letter (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>). These facts show that we have to distinguish whether the keratitis is stromal keratitis related to herpes simplex virus or microbial infectious keratitis.</p>
 <p>From the results of this study, we concluded that it is important to evaluate the patient for fungal keratitis and <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis before deciding on the use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of the keratitis. Because correct differentiation of bacterial or fungal keratitis by the clinical signs or findings is difficult even for a corneal specialist,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span></sup> it is important to make a biologically proven diagnosis by smear and culture before prescribing topical corticosteroids. In addition, it is important to stop the application of topical corticosteroids immediately when keratitis does not improve by these steroids.</p>
 <p>A combination of 0.1% betamethasone sodium sulfate and fradiomycin sulfate was prescribed in at least three of the 14 cases. Along with the possibility of stromal herpetic keratitis, another possible reason for the immediate use of topical corticosteroids could be the commercial availability of corticosteroid-antibiotic combination eye drops. As O’Day DM pointed out,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i18 _i19 _i20 _i21 _i22 _i23 _i24" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>28</a></span></sup> these preparations have the potential to violate the rule of combined corticosteroid–antibiotic therapy for infectious keratitis.</p>
 <p>Accordingly, microbiological evidence, as well as a differential diagnosis of herpetic stromal keratitis, is needed when prescribing topical corticosteroids for the treatment of infectious keratitis. Although corticosteroid-antibiotic combination eye drops seem safe, they are meaningless or unsafe for treating infectious keratitis other than culture-proven bacterial keratitis.</p>
 <p>In addition to its retrospective nature, the main limitation of this study was the single-center study design. As almost all the patients had already been treated empirically with topical antibiotics by the previous ophthalmologist, it was difficult to distinguish the causative microorganism by culture. Thus, we had to diagnose the keratitis as infectious keratitis, particularly bacterial keratitis, based on the corneal findings and clinical course. Additional information from other institutions is needed to clarify the merits and demerits, as well as the background for the empirical use of topical corticosteroids for suspected microbial infectious keratitis.</p>

 <h2 id="_i17" class="section-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>This study reported a series of severe infectious keratitis cases referred to a specialized medical institution, who were given an antibiotic-steroid combination treatment. Our findings show that it is harmful to apply topical corticosteroids for keratitis that does not respond to empirical antibiotic therapy, since <i>Acanthamoeba</i> keratitis or fungal keratitis are likely involved in these topical antibiotic-resistant cases.</p>
 <p>The use of topical corticosteroids along with empirical antibiotic therapy make it difficult to distinguish the causative agent of the infection in suspected keratitis, either by culture or by the corneal findings and clinical course, and as a result, may delay the appropriate treatment and cause unfortunate outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that the use of topical corticosteroids, merely owing to ineffective empirical antibiotic therapy for keratitis, should be avoided. Microbiological evidence, as well as a differential diagnosis of herpetic stromal keratitis, is needed before prescribing topical corticosteroids for the treatment of suspected infectious keratitis.</p>
