 <p>Facility layout planning (FLP) involves the process of physically arranging all the production factors that make up the production system so it can suitably and efficiently comply with the organisation’s strategic objectives. As part of business operational strategies, FLP is considered one of the most important design decisions (Ghassemi Tari and Neghabi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0069" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Kheirkhah, Navidi, and Bidgoli <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0117" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Sun et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0232" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). It also significantly affects the efficiency of production systems and their productivity level (Altuntas and Selim <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0012" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Navidi, Bashiri, and Messi Bidgoli <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0184" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Ku, Hu, and Wang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0135" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0001">1</a> depicts a general framework of FLP, which can also be used by the reader as a guiding thread throughout this article.</p>

 <p>Efficient FLP must ensure that production schedules are met in the short, mid and long terms and at a lower cost, while adequately using space and guaranteeing, in turn, a certain degree of flexibility for future re-layouts and minimum health/security risks at work. Conversely, inefficient layouts can simultaneously lead to bottlenecks, congestion and poorly used space, and too much work underway can accumulate, while job posts can become idle or overloaded. All this can entail anxiety and ill ease for workers, accidents at work, and make the control of operations and personnel management difficult (Pérez-Gosende <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0201" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>). Moreover, if a good closeness level is lacking among the organisation’s working centres, the working day in transport activities cannot be put to the best use, which contributes no value. This is one of the main reasons why production times increase and work productivity levels lower.</p>
 <p>Despite its importance, FLP is no easy problem to solve. The most convenient generation and selection of facility layouts for an organisation involve a complex and iterative process that depends on rating the elements shaping the goods/services production system. According to the computational complexity theory, FLP is considered an NP-hard (non-polynomial hard problem) optimisation problem because no solution algorithms exist that provide an optimum solution in a reasonable polynomial time (Grobelny and Michalski <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0075" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Despite their high degree of complexity, several authors have dealt with these problems by contributing acceptable solutions in realistic calculation times.</p>
 <p>It is stressed that when FLP is planned by assuming demand remains constant throughout the planning horizon, this problem is known as static or single-period FLP (SFLP). In many production systems however, considering a single design may not be practical because the material flow is not likely to remain invariable with time. Conversely, when demand is seasonal or vastly varies, it might be more worthwhile considering a different FLP for each time period, in which case the planning approach is either dynamic or multiperiod (DFLP) (Turanoğlu and Akkaya <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0238" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Al Hawarneh, Bendak, and Ghanim <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0009" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Pournaderi, Ghezavati, and Mozafari <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0204" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). In line with this, Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) identify that DFLP has less repercussion in the scientific literature than the SFLP approach.</p>
 <p>Since the second half of the twentieth century, FLP has been a broadly discussed scientific subject because it has been considered one of the most important classic operations management and industrial engineering problems. Some literature reviews have dealt with it in more or less depth. Most have centred on specific dimensions of the problem (Anjos and Vieira <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0018" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Ahmadi, Pishvaee, and Jokar <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0005" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Saraswat, Venkatadri, and Castillo <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0220" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Keller and Buscher <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0115" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Renzi et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0210" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Saravanan and Ganesh Kumar <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0221" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Moslemipour, Lee, and Rilling <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0182" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Maganha, Silva, and Ferreira <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0167" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Pérez-Gosende, Mula, and Díaz-Madroñero <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0202" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>), but others have covered them more generally (Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Singh and Sharma <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0228" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Meller and Gau <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0176" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1996</a></span>). Despite such wide scientific coverage, research into many FLP aspects is still in its early days (Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). This is because physical layout requirements in industry constantly change to adapt to the technolocial changes related to the fourth industrial revolution, the proliferation of cyberphysical systems, increasingly more demanding market requirements, a shift to more flexible manufacturing styles that permit large product nomenclatures in increasingly smaller lots, and the development of health and safety guidelines in the workplace, which are all motivations to keep contributing to its understanding. This article presents a literature review of 232 articles published in science journals of known prestige in their category. Previously, Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) proposed an FLP classification system based on the review of 186 bibliographic sources published between 1987 and 2016. According to these authors, FLP decisions depend on the layout evolution, characteristics of workshops, formulating the problem and its resolution approaches. Here we produced a new taxonomy to extend this proposed classification by including new classification criteria based on the most recent literature review in the FLP context; namely: problem type, approach and planning phase, characteristics of production facilities, materials handling system configuration, approaches employed to generate FLP alternatives and assessment approaches. The taxonomy also deals with characteristics of FLP mathematical modelling approaches as regards model type, objective function type, data type, certain or uncertain demand, distance metrics and considered solution approach. Consequently, the main contribution of this article was detailed, accurate and structured FLP conceptualisation, contextualisation and description, which ensures the difference regarding the review study by Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).</p>
 <p>The rest of the article is arranged as follows. Section <a href="#S002">2</a> describes the employed review methodology. Section <a href="#S003">3</a> presents an FLP taxonomy. Section <a href="#S004">4</a> deals with the current trends in mathematical modelling of FLP and Section <a href="#S005">5</a> addresses its solution approaches. Approaches for layout evaluation are introduced in Section <a href="#S006">6</a>. Section <a href="#S007">7</a> discusses the decision-support tools used to tackle the FLP. Section <a href="#S008">8</a> deals with real-world applications. Section <a href="#S009">9</a> points out the gaps in the reviewed scientific literature and proposes guidelines for future research works. Finally, Section <a href="#S010">10</a> summarises the conclusions drawn in this work.</p>

 <h2 id="_i6" class="section-heading-2">2. Review methodology</h2>
 <p>The literature search about FLP was performed by considering scientific articles in the journals indexed in the <i>Science Citation Index Expanded</i> (SCIE) of <i>Web of Science</i> (WoS) for the 2010–2019 time window. The employed key words were: <i>facility(ies) layout problem; facility(ies) layout design; facility(ies) layout planning; facility(ies) layout; plant(s) layout design; plant(s) layout; layout design; facility(ies) design; facility(ies) planning.</i> Initially the search focused on fields: title, abstract, authors’ key words and <i>KeyWords Plus</i>® through the TS field label, which gave 2,083 articles. This led the authors to restrict the key words search to only the title field of each record by the TI field label, which gave 496 articles. These publications were filtered according to the authors’ critical judgment by ruling out those contributions that did not deal with the problem from the operations management viewpoint. As a result of filtering, 232 articles were selected. The employed advanced search strategy is detailed in Table&nbsp;<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">1</button>.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i10">3.1. Planning phase</h3>
  <p>Like most design engineering problems, FLP must be based on a hierarchical approach. In the first phase, departments are assigned specific locations in the facilities’ physical space, which is often known as block layout (Saraswat, Venkatadri, and Castillo <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0220" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Asef-Vaziri and Kazemi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Next the detail phase takes place, when the elements making up the production system inside each department are organised (Bukchin and Tzur <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0031" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). These phases should be dealt with consecutively in what Meller, Kirkizoglu, and Chen (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0177" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) called a top-down approach. Nonetheless, most research works available in the FLP context have dealt with both phases separately. In the present study, 86% of the works dealt with the first phase, 10% covered the second phase, and only about 4% (9 articles) worked with both phases as part of the same problem.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="S003-S2002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">3.2. Planning approach</h3>
  <p>According to the planning approach, FLP can be classified as static or dynamic. When the layout is planned by assuming that the materials flow among departments is constant throughout the planning horizon, the problem is known as SFLP. This approach is recommended for the case of production systems with low-cost facility re-layouts (Moslemipour, Lee, and Loong <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0181" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Nonetheless, considering a single design might prove impractical in most industrial sectors because the materials flow is not likely to remain invariable with time.</p>
  <p>Companies need to constantly adapt to changing market requirements. To do so, they increase or reduce their production capacity, partly or totally change technology, create new products/services, and improve and set up new processes. So having to make sufficiently flexible layouts in this context is understandable (Emami and Nookabadi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0056" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Based on the so-called dynamic planning (DFLP) approach, an optimum layout is designed for each time period in such a way that the total costs of transporting materials and those related to re-layouts in facilities are minimised (Turanoğlu and Akkaya <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0238" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Al Hawarneh, Bendak, and Ghanim <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0009" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Pournaderi, Ghezavati, and Mozafari <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0204" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>Like Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), the literature review performed in this article showed that in the past 10 years, the FLP dynamic planning approach has had less repercussion in the scientific literature than the static approach (SFLP) because only 44 of the 232 articles (18.97%) included it. According to Peng et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0200" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), dynamic layouts can be classified into flexible and robust layouts. However, according to our literature review, a decision was made to include cyclic layouts into these categories.</p>
  <p>When planning flexible layouts, an optimum arrangement scheme is designed for each time period to minimise not only the total costs of transporting materials, but also those related to re-layouts of facilities. These dynamic layouts have been more frequently dealt with in the literature in the past decade (38 of 44 articles: 86.36%).</p>
  <p>Kulturel-Konak and Konak (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0142" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) introduced cyclic layouts as a special dynamic layouts case. With this approach, the planning horizon is divided into T periods, <i>t</i> = 1, … , <i>T</i>. After period <i>T</i>, the material flow matrix among departments returns to its initial state during period <i>t</i> = 1. Apart from product demand, the area requirements of some departments may also change seasonally.</p>
  <p>In the robust design approach is considered a single layout outline for the whole planning horizon, with different stochastic demand scenarios (Moslemipour, Lee, and Loong <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0181" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). In fact as this unique design is used for each time period, this approach incurs no reorganisation cost. The robust design is not necessarily an optimum design for a given time period, but proves suitable throughout the temporary planning horizon as it minimises the cost of transporting materials (Madhusudanan Pillai, Hunagund, and Krishnan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0166" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). So the advantage of the robust approach is that it does not incur reorganisation costs, while its disadvantage lies in it not being an optimum design for each time period (Peng et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0200" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). This method is suitable for settings with a high facilities re-layout cost (Moslemipour, Lee, and Loong <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0181" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), such as those firms that need heavy machinery to perform their operations. Despite its importance, this approach has scarcely appeared in the literature about DFLP in the past 10 years (5 of 44 articles, 11.36%).</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i15">3.3. Characteristics of facilities</h3>
  <p>Both complexity and the FLP solution method depend on the characteristics of facilities to a great extent. For example with FLP, it is essential to start with previous knowledge about the number of buildings and floors required inside buildings to perform normal industrial operations, as well as the shape, area and dimensions of departments.</p>
  <p>Most of the reviewed research works considered the facility layout design in a single building and/or on a single floor. In practice however, large firms often consider more than one floor, and even several buildings, to perform their operations. Only two research works contemplated several buildings simultaneously in SFLP (Helber et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0082" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Kaveh, Shakouri, and Zolfaghari <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0114" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>), and only one article did so in DFLP (Al Hawarneh, Bendak, and Ghanim <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0009" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). For SFLP, 18 works considered several floors when planning the layout, but only one contemplated these conditions in a dynamic setting (Kia et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0120" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Although one of the classic principles of facility layout is to make as much use of space in industrial facilities as possible, the tridimensional space in FLP has scarcely been considered. In fact only three works actually contemplated this requirement in the SFLP context (Ejeh, Liu, and Papageorgiou <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0055" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Latifi, Mohammadi, and Khakzad <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0147" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Park, Shin, and Won <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0199" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), and no work did so in the DFLP domain. All the other reviewed works in this study considered space only from a bidimensional viewpoint.</p>
  <p>Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0004">4</a> depicts how articles were distributed according to the area, shape and dimensions of departments. Departments can be regularly or irregularly shaped (Ahmadi, Pishvaee, and Jokar <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0005" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). In the first case, which appeared more often in the literature (222 articles, 95.69%), departments were rectangular (Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>). Irregularly shaped departments were generally polygons whose summed inner angles came to at least 270° (Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Of all the works dealing with irregular shapes, one considered departments to be hexagons (Chung and Tanchoco <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0043" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>), while the rest contemplated rectangular departments combined to others in the form of non-convex polygons (Asef-Vaziri and Kazemi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Bukchin and Tzur <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0031" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Defersha and Hodiya <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0046" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Regarding areas when planning layouts, departments with exactly equal or different areas can be considered (Feng and Che <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0058" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), and using discrete or continuous optimisation models depends on what these areas are like (Allahyari and Azab <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0010" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Three categories were found for department dimensions: fixed or flexible (Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0252" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) and mixed. For fixed dimensions, the problem is formulated according to the assumption that the width and length of departments must remain intact when arranged in space. When dimensions are considered flexible, the width and length of departments may vary within a pre-set interval during the arrangement process. This variation can be controlled by aspect ratios (proportion between the longest side and the shortest side of each department) (Abdollahi, Aslam, and Yazdi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0001" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Friedrich, Klausnitzer, and Lasch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0061" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Liu and Liu <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0160" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), area ratios (the minimum proportion that the department area must occupy to the total available area) (Gai and Ji <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0063" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), by ensuring a minimum area (Xie et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0255" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) or by defining the pre-set interval for length or width for departments (Neghabi, Eshghi, and Salmani <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0185" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Garcia-Hernandez et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0068" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i17">3.4. Materials handling system configuration</h3>
  <p>As seen in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0005">5</a>, according to how the system to transport materials is configured, six facility layout categories are defined (Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>): single-row layout problem, SRLP; double-row layout problem, DRLP; parallel-row layout problem, PRLP; multi-row layout problem, MRLP; loop layout problem, LLP; open-field layout problem, OFLP. In them we do not include the multi-floor layout classification (multi-floor layout problem, MFLP), which Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) consider, because it is believed that each floor can have any of the six afore-mentioned configurations. Nonetheless, the MFLP criterion was independently considered in the FLP classification in accordance with the number of floors (Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0003">3</a>).</p>

  <p>Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0006">6</a> shows the frequency with which these configurations are dealt with considering that some articles have contemplated more than one scheme. As shown below, OFLP is the most widespread configuration when studying SFLP with 53.19% of cases, followed by MRLP with 32.98%. In DFLP, MRLP stands out with 70.45%, followed next by OFLP with 22.73%. The LLP, DRLP and PRLP configurations have received very little attention under the static planning approach, and no attention under the dynamic approach.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i20">3.5. Problem type</h3>
  <p>As Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0003">3</a> depicts, layouts can be planned for completely new plants, which are often called greenfield layout designs, or in existing plants, which implies talking about re-layout. In the literature, more attention has been generally paid to the first case, where the layout plan is designed without the influence of the restrictions that normally occur when doing so in an existing facility. Despite its limited importance in the literature, the re-layout problem is more frequent in practice (Kulturel-Konak <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0136" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>). Of all the bibliographic sources consulted in this research work, only 11.21% dealt with the second problem (26 articles). Problem type, as an FLP classification criterion, was not considered in any former review work as far as the authors know (Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Heragu <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0083" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1992</a></span>; Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Kouvelis, Chiang, and Kiran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0130" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1992</a></span>; Kouvelis and Kiran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0131" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>; Maganha, Silva, and Ferreira <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0167" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Meller and Gau <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0176" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1996</a></span>; Singh and Sharma <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0228" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>).</p>

  <p>As far as the authors are aware, no approaches for generating alternatives have been identified or dealt with on the whole in any previous review study in the FLP context (Heragu <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0083" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1992</a></span>; Kouvelis and Kiran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0131" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>; Kouvelis, Chiang, and Kiran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0130" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1992</a></span>; Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Singh and Sharma <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0228" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Meller and Gau <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0176" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1996</a></span>). Mathematical programming (MP) has been traditionally covered in-depth as an approach to achieve optimum distribution or a set of acceptable solutions with different FLP variants. Nonetheless, our literature review identified research works that dealt with other approaches for the same objective, such as computer-aided planning tools (SP) or experts’ knowledge (EK). We stress that some research works on FLP did not begin by generating layout alternatives, but focused exclusively on testing new assessment approaches for the alternatives generated in former research works (Chung and Tanchoco <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0043" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Durmusoglu <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0053" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Jahanshahloo et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0099" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Maniya and Bhatt <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0168" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>; Yang, Deuse, and Jiang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0260" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013b</a></span>). Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0007">7</a> (a) distributes the articles that contemplated approaches to generate alternatives for both SFLP and DFLP. Given their relevance, FLP formulation approaches using MP are dealt with separately in Section <a href="#S004">4</a> herein.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i26">4.1. Problem representation</h3>
  <p>When formulating the FLP mathematical optimisation model, characterising the problem <i>a priori</i> in accordance with the categories specified within the conceptual framework presented in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0003">3</a> is recommended. In particular, the shape and area of departments can be especially relevant because whether a discrete or continuous representation modelling approach is applied will depend on this (Allahyari and Azab <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0010" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). When contemplating regular-shaped equal-area departments, the problem can be formulated using discrete mathematical models for the common objective to optimally assign n departments to n set and discrete locations known <i>a priori</i> to, for example, minimise the cost of transporting materials (Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0252" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). In such cases, the most widely used optimisation model was the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) introduced by Koopmans and Beckmann (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0125" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1957</a></span>). For a deeper understanding of the formulation of this model as well as its resolution strategies, readers are referred to Frieze and Yadegar (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0062" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1983</a></span>), Cela (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0033" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>), Nehi and Gelareh (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0187" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>), and Loiola et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0165" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Moreover when assuming that departments are irregularly shaped and/or have different area requirements, they can be located anywhere in a planar continuous space available in the facilities to avoid overlapping departments (la Scalia et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0146" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), among other relevant constraints. In this case, the problem’s complexity even increases for situations in which only a few departments are to be arranged (Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0252" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), and tend to be generally formulated by continuous representation modelling approaches. It is sometimes possible to divide departments into common area units (unit cells) and use a discrete approach to deal with the problem (Allahyari and Azab <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0010" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Huang and Wong <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0093" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>).</p>
  <p>In the reviewed literature, the most widely used MP approaches in FLP modelling with continuous representation for departments with unequal areas were mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) (Gulsen, Murray, and Smith <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0078" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Vázquez-Román et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0244" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Yang et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0257" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) in 52.46% of the cases, and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) (Allahyari and Azab <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0010" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Ejeh, Liu, and Papageorgiou <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0055" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Kia et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0120" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Klausnitzer and Lasch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0123" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0252" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) with approximately 28%. Albeit less frequently, non-linear programing (NLP) was also used (Anjos and Vieira <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0017" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Ahmadi and Akbari Jokar <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0004" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Zhenyuan et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0267" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>), as were: linear integer programming (LIP) (Friedrich, Klausnitzer, and Lasch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0061" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Asef-Vaziri and Kazemi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Samarghandi and Eshghi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0216" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) and linear programming (LP) (Gai and Ji <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0063" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Y. J. Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0254" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Kulturel-Konak <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0137" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>).</p>
  <p>Generally speaking, the models proposed in FLP mathematical formulations were subject (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) to some of these constraints: (1) budget; (2) area; (3) capacity; (4) non-overlapping; (5) location of pick up and drop off points; (6) orientation of departments; (7) clearance among departments; (8) closeness of departments; (9) ordering of departments; (10) distance between departments; (11) minimum safety distance; (12) quantity of floors; (13) aspect ratio; (14) number of lifts; (15) tridimensional space; (16) location of machines; (17) material flow conservation; (18) level of proximity among departments; (19) number of material handling devices; (20) work in process; (21) material flow demand; (22) length of the piping system to transport fluids; (23) release of toxic gases; (24) hazardous events with a domino effect, like fires or explosions; (25) symmetry-breaking constraints; (26) location of departments adjacent to flow paths; (27) connectivity constraints; (28) area occupied by pumping systems; (29) heat exchanger group constraint; (30) safety instrumented system’s life cycle cost; (31) machine availability; (32) number of machines per department; (33) transport time.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i27">4.2. Objective function</h3>
  <p>In the reviewed literature, the minimised objective functions were: (a) materials handling cost; (b) rearrangement cost; (c) construction cost; (d) flow distance; (e) flow path length; (f) transport time; (g) work flow; (h) personnel flow; (i) work in process; (j) total layout area; (k) space demand; (l) space among departments; (m) aspect ratio; (n) land cost; (o) costs related to material handling equipment; (p) costs related to workplace security risks; (q) costs related to machinery operations; (r) risk level associated with the hazardous materials and waste path; (s) makespan; (t) energy losses; (u) financial risk; (v) lost opportunity costs; (w) occupational health/safety risks; (x) number of machines arranged in a linear sequence; (y) entropy.</p>
  <p>The maximised objective functions were: (A) the closeness rating among departments; (B) the decision maker’s level of satisfaction; (C) distance requests among departments; (D) the hazardous movement; (E) the total material flow among adjancent departments; (F) the area utilisation ratio; (G) work stations’ utilisation ratio; (H) the level of preference for assigning facilities to spaces; (J) the level of preference in relation to interactivity among departments.</p>
  <p>Approximately 78% of the reviewed articles that had formulated FLP as a mathematical optimisation problem had considered a single-objective function of those previously cited (163 of the 209 articles), which were either quantitative or qualitative (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2). The present work distinguished between these two categories because some objective functions referenced in the literature represent variables that can be measured on a ratio scale, which confers it its quantitative nature, whereas some objective functions denote variables measured on an ordinal categorical scale and are, thus, classified as qualitative.</p>
  <p>Minimising the total materials handling cost (MHC) is the most widespread objective function in FLP optimisation models (62.68%), followed by flow distance minimisation (24.4%), rearrangement cost minimisation (19.62%), maximisation of the closeness rating among departments (10%), and minimisation of the costs related to material handling equipment (8.13%).</p>
  <p>Within industrial companies, MHC is a key factor for obtaining optimum layouts (Singh and Ingole <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0227" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), and has been the most widely used quantitative-type objective function to find optimum or suboptimum FLP solutions in the last 10 years (131 articles). When solving any FLP problem however, taking quantitative factors as a single-objective function can generate solutions that are not necessarily feasible because qualitative factors in some industrial contexts and services can be more relevant, such as closeness ratings among departments, flexibility or security.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously considering both types of factors as part of a mathematical optimisation model normally requires seeking a compromise solution that falls in line with the decision maker’s preferences (Le, Dao, and Chaabane <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0148" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Che, Zhang, and Feng <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0036" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). This occurs because the objectives to be optimised often clash (Ripon et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0211" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>); that is, improving an objective can make another/other objective/s worse, and there is no absolute solution in these cases to simultaneously optimise all objectives (Aiello, La Scalia, and Enea <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0007" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). The mathematical process to seek a compromise solution is known as multi-objective optimisation (Ripon et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0211" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Aiello, La Scalia, and Enea <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0007" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). In the reviewed literature, only one fifth of the articles published in the SFLP context dealt with the problem by multi-objective optimisation models, and 29.55% did so in the DFLP domain.</p>

 <div id="S004-S2003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i28">4.3. Data type</h3>
  <p>When solving FLP mathematical optimisation models, some parameters are included for the cost/profit coefficients of the objective function that are related to materials flow, distance covered and unit transport cost, among others, which might be known, or not, <i>a priori</i>. When these input data are not known exactly, they need to be estimated given their non-deterministic nature. To do so, simulated data have been used in the literature about FLP (Peng et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0200" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Brunoro Ahumada, Quddus, and Mannan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0030" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Azimi and Soofi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0026" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), as have fuzzy sets with different membership functions (Safarzadeh and Koosha <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0213" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Gai and Ji <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0063" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Nematian <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0188" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>).</p>
 </div>
 <div id="S004-S2004" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i29">4.4. Demand type</h3>
  <p>Demand is a fundamental parameter of production planning models, and the material flow between production departments depends directly on it which is, in turn, an essential parameter in most FLP mathematical optimisation models. The more intense the material flow is among the activity centres participating in the worked object’s processing, the closer the proximity must be among them to reduce MHC as much as possible. Thus any mistake in estimating demand could lead to an insufficient layout in relation to these costs (Jithavech and Krishnan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0106" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>).</p>
  <p>When considering the re-layout of existing plants, quite accurate demand information may become available. Therefore, the volumes of the deterministic materials flow for the whole planning horizon can be identified through production plans. In such cases, demand is considered to be known, and spatially laying out the elements making up the production system is facilitated in the available space inside industrial facilities. Nonetheless, when layout is planned for completely new facilities and the company possesses no previous information about how demand behaves, production plans begin by estimating demand under uncertainty conditions. In production planning models, uncertainty is modelled by using probability distributions, fuzzy sets, stochastic approaches and robust approaches (Díaz-Madroñero, Mula, and Peidro <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0049" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). Given the strategical-tactical planning interrelation in production and layout planning, the complexity of FLP and, therefore, its modelling and solution approaches, depend on demand being certain or uncertain and its variability throughout the planning horizon to a great extent.</p>
  <p>In the revised literature on FLP, 93.3% of works began by assuming that demand was known beforehand and, therefore, the material flow was deterministic. Some authors resorted to simulation by considering several scenarios to describe the effect of fluctuating demand on the material flow (Peng et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0200" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Other authors modelled demand uncertainty by assuming demand to exactly fit a continuous probability distribution with a known mean and variance that could be uniform (Jithavech and Krishnan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0106" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>), beta (Zhao and Wallace <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0264" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>), normal (Moslemipour, Lee, and Loong <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0181" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Tayal and Singh <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0236" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) or exponential (Vitayasak, Pongcharoen, and Hicks <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0246" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Vitayasak and Pongcharoen <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0245" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). To the same end, the queueing theory (Pourvaziri and Pierreval <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0206" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) or fuzzy sets with different membership functions (Kaveh, Dalfard, and Amiri <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0112" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Samarghandi, Taabayan, and Behroozi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0217" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) have also been used.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i30">4.5. Distance metrics</h3>
  <p>As minimising total MHC is the most widespread objective function in FLP optimisation models, the location of the points in each department where materials are picked up and dropped off, plus the distance metrics to be considered, are fundamental. Generally speaking, total MHC is determined by the summation of multiplying the cost of transporting one flow unit at one distance unit and the total transported volume between the points at which materials are picked up/dropped off in all the departments that take part in the worked object’s processing (Komarudin and Wong <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0124" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; McKendall and Liu <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0175" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Tubaileh and Siam <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0237" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Nonetheless, when modelling layout in facilities, it is often assumed that the points at which materials are picked up/dropped off are located in the centroid of each department, and the distance among these centroids determines the distance covered by the work flow (Kovacs <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0132" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0254" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Zhang et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0263" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0009">9</a> shows that this assumed case was the most widely used one in the reviewed literature.</p>
  <p>Such assumptions are, however, incompatible with most real-life layouts. It is more realistic to assume that the points at which materials are picked up/dropped off would be located on the edges of departments, and the work flow would flow along the flow paths or circulation routes that interconnect them (Friedrich, Klausnitzer, and Lasch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0061" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Leno, Saravana Sankar, and Ponnambalam <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0154" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). Hence those models that contemplate rectilinear or euclidean distances can generate pseudo-optimal solutions with significantly lower total MHC than those incurred in real production systems where flow covers the distance separating the pick up/drop off points between each pair of departments along its perimeter or contour (metric CB), or along the pre-set material flow path (metric FB). These last two approaches were two of the least frequently employed in the literature.</p>

 <h2 id="_i31" class="section-heading-2">5. Solution approach</h2>
 <p>FLP is classified as a non-polynomial hard problem according to the computational complexity theory because no algorithm exists that provides an optimal solution in an reasonable polynomial time (Grobelny and Michalski <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0075" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Despite this degree of complexity, some authors have contributed acceptable solutions with realistic calculation times by applying a range of techniques, from exact techniques to last-generation heuristic ones.</p>
 <p>The methods generally followed to seek optimal or quasi-optimal solutions for FLP can be classified as exact, approximate, stochastic and intelligent (Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). As Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0008">8</a> depicts, hybrid and matheuristic approaches are added to these categories because they have been identified in the solution approaches put forward in the revised literature.</p>
 <p>The approximate approaches corresponded to heuristic algorithms. In the FLP context, heuristic methods are classified as construction, improvement or metaheuristic algorithms (Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). In the past 10 years, the most popular approximate methods to solve FLP optimisation models have been metaheuristic algorithms. In the reviewed literature, we identified that 28 of these algorithms were applied in 68% of the articles that used discrete mathematical optimisation models, and in 64.18% of those that employed continuous models. In general, the most frequently used algorithms were genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm, tabu search, ant colony and variable neighbourhood search, which collectively corresponded to about 80% of all cases. A more detailed description of these algorithms for SFLP and DFLP is found in Appendix 4. All the other identified heuristic algorithms were chosen as the solution approach for 5.33% and 12.12% of the articles that used discrete and continuous optimisation models, respectively.</p>
 <p>It is well-known that the FLP complexity level exponentially increases according to the number of entities (departments, work cells, workstations, machines) to be arranged (Vitayasak, Pongcharoen, and Hicks <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0246" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Turanoğlu and Akkaya <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0238" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). For this purpose, the solution approaches that generate quasi-optimal or approximate solutions were the most widespread in large-scale problems. For a few entities however, exact solution approaches fulfilled their purpose in acceptable calculation times. Along these lines, it is stressed that Palubeckis (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0193" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>) successfully applied branch and bound (B&amp;B) to a QAP solution for an SRLP problem with 35 departments, whereas Huang and Wong (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0093" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) did so to solve an MILP by contemplating an OFLP configuration for 11 departments. Asef-Vaziri and Kazemi (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) applied branch and cut (B&amp;C) to solve an LIP model applied to the classic problems put forward by other authors, which included between 61 and 310 departments according to an LLP configuration. Hernández Gress et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0084" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>) solved an MILP model for seven departments by following an OFLP outline using a block layout, while Amaral and Letchford (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0016" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) applied the same method along with B&amp;C to solve an LP model, which they applied to several test problems with 5–30 departments with an SRLP outline. Hungerländer and Rendl (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0096" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) and Hungerländer (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0094" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>) applied semidefinite relaxation to solve SDP models with an SRLP configuration. Hungerländer and Anjos (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0095" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) followed a similar solution approach, which was also applied to DRLP, PRLP and MRLP configurations. Jankovits et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0100" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>) used both semidefinite relaxation and convex relaxation to solve SDP models with an OFLP configuration.</p>
 <p>To the authors’ knowledge, in the revised literature the largest numbers of departments optimally arranged in a facility layout design according to the materials handling system configuration were: 42 for SRLP (Hungerländer and Rendl <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0096" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), 10 for DRLP (Hungerländer and Anjos <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0095" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>), 23 for PRLP (Amaral <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0015" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), 20 for MRLP (Feng and Che <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0058" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), 310 for LLP (Asef-Vaziri and Kazemi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), and 100 for OFLP (Anjos and Vieira <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0017" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>).</p>
 <p>An emerging approach to solve mathematical optimisation models that can be considered for FLP is matheuristics; in other words, those algorithms that derive from the metaheuristics and MP techniques interoperation. Kulturel-Konak and Konak (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0141" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) developed a hybrid solution approach called GA/LP, which combines a genetic algorithm (GA) with LP to solve an MINLP model. Kulturel-Konak and Konak (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0142" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) performed a large-scale local search (LSLS) based on simulated annealing (SA) hybridisation and MILP, which they called LS-HSA. Kulturel-Konak (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0138" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>) created a matheuristic solution approach based on variable neighbourhood search (VNS) and SA combined with an MINLP model that they called VNSAM. Feng et&nbsp;al. (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0059" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) implemented two hybrid approaches to solve an MINLP model by combining GA and SA, respectively, with LP, which they named GALP and SALP. As far as the authors of this work know, no matheuristic solution approaches appear in any of the more recent literature review studies (Drira, Pierreval, and Hajri-Gabouj <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0052" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>; Heragu <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0083" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1992</a></span>; Hosseini-Nasab et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0088" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Kouvelis, Chiang, and Kiran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0130" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1992</a></span>; Kouvelis and Kiran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0131" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>; la Scalia, Micale, and Enea <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0145" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Maganha, Silva, and Ferreira <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0167" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Meller and Gau <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0176" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1996</a></span>; Singh and Sharma <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0228" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>).</p>

 <h2 id="_i32" class="section-heading-2">6. Approaches for layout evaluation</h2>
 <p>Assessments are important for identifying the best layout among a finite set of alternatives generated by some of the above-described approaches, or to even detect improvement opportunities in an already existing production system’s productivity. The FLP approaches in the literature have focused on generating layout alternatives and very few advances have been made in the assessment stage (Shahin and Poormostafa <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0224" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>). This is probably why very little attention has been paid to the re-layout of existing facilities because re-layout decisions are usually made as a result of an assessment process when an existing layout does not allow the objectives set by an organisation to be met (Pérez-Gosende <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0201" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>).</p>
 <p>In our work, 38 articles dealt with assessing facility layout alternatives (16.38%). Towards this objective, these works employed simulation, data envelopment analysis (DEA), non-linear programming models, (NLP), fuzzy constraint theory (f-TOC), simple criteria comparison (CC) or multicriteria decision making methods (MCDM). MCDM were the most widely used in the literature (20 articles, 52.63%). The following methods were found: AHP, (analytic hierarchy process), TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution), ANP (analytic network process), ELECTRE (elimination et choix traduisant la realité), DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory), PSI (preference selection index) and SAW (simple additive weighting). Although some works followed more than one method, Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F0007">7</a>(b) shows how the articles that dealt with approaches to assess layout alternatives are distributed.</p>
 <p>It is worth stressing that only two works evaluated layout alternatives in the DFLP context. The followed methods in these cases were TOPSIS (Emami and Nookabadi <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0056" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) and DEA (Bozorgi, Abedzadeh, and Zeinali <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0029" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>).</p>

<div id="S007" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_1">
 <h2 id="_i33" class="section-heading-2">7. Decision-support tools</h2>
 <p>Decision-support tools can play a fundamental role in improving the capability of decision makers to evaluate and decide how suitable different solution alternatives can be regarding as pre-established goals or criteria (Taticchi et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0235" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). In this context, when tackling FLPs five different groups of decision-support tools can be considered. Firstly, for those analysts interested in generating several layout alternatives to select the most suitable one to their preferences, computer-aided layout planning tools can be used. Secondly, for small-scale problems formulated through mathematical programming models, optimisation solvers can be employed to find the optimal solution. A third group involves programming the languages needed to code heuristic algorithms to find approximate solutions to large-scale problems. A fourth group comprises simulation software to simulate non-deterministic parameters in mathematical programming models or to evaluate performance in different layout scenarios. Last but not least, to gain intuitive impressions of the obtained layout solutions, computer-aided design software can be useful for representing bidimensional or tridimensional facility layout drawings.</p>
 <p>According to the five aforementioned categories, all the decision-support tools used in the articles dealing with SFLP and DFLP are, respectively, identified and classified in Tables&nbsp;<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">2</button> and <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0003">3</button>. Furthermore, given the relevance of the first group of tools for practitioners, Table&nbsp;<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0004">4</button> briefly describes those used in the revised literature to generate layout alternatives. To know about any other software available in previous research works, readers are referred to the review by Singh and Sharma (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0228" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>).</p>

 <p>&nbsp;The world's most represented region in these real case studies was East Asia with almost half the cases (49%).

 <p>&nbsp;It is also worth highlighting that 70% of the cases addressed greenfield plant layout designs, 79% planned block layouts, 94% contemplated constant product demand throughout the planning horizon (i.e. SFLP) and 64% adopted an open-field materials handling system configuration. Furthermore, 72% of the cases used mathematical programming to generate layouts, mainly through QAP (24%) and MIP (36%) modelling approaches, which were solved mostly with metaheuristic algorithms (45%).</p>

 <h2 id="_i37" class="section-heading-2">9. Discussion</h2>
 <p>In today’s industrial context, industrial FLP must be flexible enough in time to face uncertain demand, adopt new technologies, allow new processes to be set up and produce a large product nomenclature in increasingly smaller lots. Considering static production conditions as in, for example, the demand remaining constant throughout the temporary planning horizon does not match reality, but is, however, the most widely considered planned approach in the scientific literature on FLP. Thus researchers should pay more attention to study FLP in dynamic environments.</p>
 <p>The intention behind planning flexible or cyclic layouts in the DFLP context is to design an optimum layout for each time period to minimise total MHC and those related to facility rearrangements. Nonetheless, the reviewed works that dealt with these planning approaches did not contemplate the opportunity costs incurred while implementing re-layouts. Likewise, most of the works that covered DFLP (approx. 93%) started by assuming that companies had unlimited budgets to put into practice any changes related to layouts from one time period to another when, in fact, budgets for such purposes are always limited. So considering budget constraints when formulating layout optimisation models in dynamic settings is suggested.</p>
 <p>Most works into FLP sought design solutions for completely new facilities. With layouts for already existing facilities, the task is just as complex, or even more complicated, given the presence of constraints and additional objectives. Implementing changes of an existing layout requires further investment, delays or having to completely interrupt production plans while the re-layout lasts.</p>
 <p>It is noteworthy that most of the scientific literature about FLP examined the block layout or the detailed phase separately. They paid very little attention to analyse both phases in a hierarchical or concurrent manner as part of the same study. Separately dealing with these phases incurs the risk of the first phase outcomes limiting the second phase, or <i>vice versa</i>, especially if we consider that sizes of departments are flexible with a pre-set interval of the aspect/area ratio as a trick to facilitate generating more regular-shaped layouts with mathematical optimisation models.</p>
 <p>Despite optimising space inside industrial facilities being considered a classic facility layout principle, analysing space is often considered only from a bidimensional point of view.</p>
 <p>The herein reviewed works generally considered facility layout design in only one building and on only one floor. However, large companies frequently contemplated their operations in more than one building and on several floors. So more attention must be paid to FLP modelling by contemplating material handling system configurations that have scarcely been addressed in the literature, such as DRLP, PRLP and LLP.</p>
 <p>Despite a large body of scientific literature works on FLP, very few works examined the layout assessment stage, and no references appeared about procedures to objectively diagnose re-layout needs, which is a gap that future research works can consider bridging.</p>
 <p>MCDM methods are frequently used in the literature to assess facility layout alternatives. Yet despite them being widespread, MCDM techniques only offer relative measures to compare several layout alternatives. This means they are not useful for assessing the performance of a current layout in industrial facilities; in other words, they do not enable the re-layout requirement to be analysed.</p>
 <p>Most FLP optimisation models seek to minimise a single quantitative objective function, and MHC is the most frequent one. In practice however, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors simultaneously can be decisive for many manufacturing or service systems. Qualitative factors like proximity ratings among departments, layout flexibility to integrate future changes, personnel satisfaction, and health and safety (especially with healthcare emergencies requiring interpersonal distancing) must be considered in particular. This will certainly involve the scientific community having to pay more attention to FLP multi-objective mathematical modelling, as the present work demonstrates, which is underrated because single-objective models are normally resorted to.</p>
 <p>Of the studies that employed mathematical optimisation models as a preferential approach to generate layout alternatives, approximately 89% considered deterministic and already known parameters. Although this assumption is plausibly suitable for some contexts, obtaining exact cost/profit coefficients of the objective function is hardly likely given the measurement errors and random component that always appear in some forecasting methods, like those based on historic series to forecast demand. Hence the need to more frequently employ methods that model uncertainty in some datasets, like demand, material flow, materials handling unit costs and sizes of facilities. To this end, using probability distributions, fuzzy sets, stochastic and/or robust approaches is recommended.</p>
 <p>Similarly, in order to avoid pseudo-optimal solutions when modelling FLP, investigating the formulation and solution of multi-objective mathematical optimisation models is suggested because they allow the following to be concurrently designed by adopting quantitative/qualitative criteria: spatial layout and orientation of the work stations making up the production system; passageways through which the worked object and personnel pass; the points at which the worked object is picked up/dropped off. To do so, more realistic distance metrics than the conventional intercentroid rectilinear or euclidean distances need to be considered. It might be worth contemplating the fact that work flows cover the distance separating the points at which materials between two departments are picked up/dropped off along their perimeter or contour (Leno, Saravana Sankar, and Ponnambalam <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0153" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2016</a></span>; Friedrich, Klausnitzer, and Lasch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0061" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), or along pre-set flow paths (Kim and Chae <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0121" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Klausnitzer and Lasch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0123" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).</p>
 <p>Given its complexity, the computational time required to solve FLP in any of its variants increases exponentially along with the size of the problem (Vitayasak, Pongcharoen, and Hicks <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0246" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Turanoğlu and Akkaya <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0238" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). So exact methods are only useful for finding optimum solutions for minor problems. This is why approximate approaches like metaheuristics have been popular for seeking suboptimum solutions in recent years. Nonetheless, it is necessary to keep developing alternative solution approaches and, as this review work identifies, a set of matheuristic algorithms has emerged in recent years for FLP with good results (Feng et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0059" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Kulturel-Konak <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0138" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Kulturel-Konak and Konak <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0141" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0142" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). Thus future research that continues to investigate this emerging solution approach is recommended.</p>
 <p>Another relevant element worth stressing is that FLP mathematical optimisation models basically focus on solving classic reference problems (the so-called test problems or benchmark instances). They have often been theoretically developed and do not respond to real case studies. This tendency has also been noted in previous research (Meller, Kirkizoglu, and Chen <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0177" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Ulutas and Attila Islier <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0240" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Kovacs <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0132" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Therefore, future research works to model real situations is recommended in order to help bridge the existing gap because very little research about FLP has been conducted in practice.</p>
 <p>Last but no least, it is worth noting that most of the computer-aided planning tools used in the revised literature for generating layout alternatives are unavailable for commercial use. So future research needs to develop new web-accessible tools to ease practitioners’ effective FLP decision making.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i38">9.1. Managerial implications</h3>
  <p>Based on what our literature review evidenced and the theme being widely covered, operations managers can obtain a clearer holistic view of the importance of facility planning and its impact on the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing systems to make decisions that allow them to more efficiently perform industrial operations.</p>
  <p>When planning facility layouts and guaranteeing the highest possible level of adjacency among the work centres participating in the worked object’s processing, MHC is minimised which can, in turn, significantly reduce manufacturing costs. However, as we insist throughout our literature review, concentrating only on minimising quantitative factors, like costs, is far from ideal because other relevant criteria need to be considered, such as suitably using the tridimensional space within facilities to ensure a certain degree of flexibility for future re-layouts, minimum health/safety risks in the workplace, etc.</p>
  <p>Evaluating closeness ratings among departments based on qualitative criteria can be done by experts’ judgment. This idea is based on the assumption that the number of factors considered by a group is bigger than that considered by one person. Each expert can contribute the idea that he/she has about the matter from his/her knowledge area to general discussion.</p>
  <p>All the variants of FLP modelling approaches require analysts having a high level of knowledge about their formulation and solution, which could be achieved through exact, heuristic, stochastic, matheuristic, intelligent or hybrid methods. In turn, these approaches demand making many data collection and calculation efforts. For all these reasons, such tools are not widely employed by operations managers in businesses. Nonetheless, specialised computer-aided planning tools like VIP-PLANOPT (Engineering Optimization Software <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0057" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>) can contribute to search for specific solutions to analyse production systems’ given needs. Facility layout decisions do not enable empirical research based on trial and error. An objective planning process must exist as background.</p>
  <p>Operations managers can take the FLP taxonomy presented herein as a reference and characterise the reality of the manufacturing systems that they administer with it. This, combined with a cost/profit analysis, could lay some solid foundations for short-, mid- and long-term decision making about the feasibility of adopting flexible or robust layouts in line with internal strong/weak points, and in agreement with the threats and opportunities from the immediate business environment where operations are performed.</p>

 <h2 id="_i39" class="section-heading-2">10. Conclusions</h2>
 <p>Industrial facility layouts are defined as a process to physically arrange the factors shaping the production system so that they suitably and efficiently fulfil the organisation’s strategical objectives. This is considered a strategical decision within business operations planning because its high cost often prevents it from being taken as a feasible option during short time periods, and the efficiency, productivity and competetiveness of manufacturing systems depend on it to a great extent.</p>
 <p>Our systematic literature review of 232 scientific articles in the FLP domain allowed us to identify the different reference frameworks that led to a new conceptual framework being proposed to classify FLP based on: problem type (new facilities or re-layout); planning approach (static or dynamic); planning phase (joint or detailed distribution); characteristics of facilities (number of buildings, number of floors, considering the space, shape and area of departments); materials handling system configuration (single-row, double-row, multiple-row, parallel-row, closed-loop and open-field configurations); generating and assessing alternatives.</p>
 <p>Generating layout alternatives has been dealt with mainly by mathematical optimisation models, specifically with discrete quadratic programming models for equal-sized departments, or by continuous linear/non-linear mixed integer programming models for departments with unequal areas. Other approaches to generate layout alternatives involve resorting to EK and specialised SP. For FLP mathematical programming approaches, current modelling trends and their solution approaches were identified by bearing in mind: type of mathematical model (discrete, continuous); nature of the objective function (single-objective, multi-objective); data type (deterministic, non-deterministic); consideration of certain/uncertain demand; employed distance metrics (rectilinear, euclidean, squared euclidean, chebychev, contour-based and flow path-based); the adopted solution approach (exact, approximate, stochastic, matheuristic, intelligent and hybrid). Generally speaking, the most widely used solution algorithms were metaheuristic: genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm, tabu search, ant colony and variable neighbourhood searches. Here, we have reviewed the literature published by May, 2020. In the meantime, several new studies on the FLP problem have appeared (Liu et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0163" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Wan et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0247" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Xiao et&nbsp;al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0253" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Kovács <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0133" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Ahmadi-Javid and Ardestani-Jaafari <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0003" data-reflink="_i41 _i42" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>) which corroborates the strong interest in this research area.</p>
 <p>Finally, the guidelines identified herein for future research are presented: (i) studying in-depth FLP in dynamic settings; (ii) minimising opportunity costs while contemplating re-layouts to cushion the impact of these costs on an organisation’s profitability; (iii) considering budget constraints to formulate DFLP optimisation models; (iv) more research into the re-layouts of existing facilities; (v) considering block and detailed layouts as part of the same problem by a hierarchical or concurrent approach; (vi) contemplating the tridimensional space for DFLP and SFLP; (vii) taking into account several floors/buildings in FLP mathematical modelling; (viii) bearing in mind the material handling system configuration in FLP models; (ix) modelling the uncertainty of relevant cost/profit coefficients; (x) conducting more research about the assessment phase of layout alternatives; (xi) developing and applying matheuristic approaches, and those based on artificial intelligence, as alternative solution approaches for FLP models; (xii) using more multi-objective approaches to generate layout alternatives; (xiii) applying the proposed FLP models to real cases; (xiv) developing new commercial computer-aided layout planning tools to ease practitioners’ FLP-related decision making.</p>
