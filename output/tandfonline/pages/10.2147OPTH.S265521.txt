 <p>Tuberculosis is a major global health issue with an important burden of disease, leading to significant mortality and morbidity worldwide.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1</a></span></sup> Despite progress in detection and treatment of tuberculosis and a decline in the mortality over the last decade, more than 1.3 million individuals died from this disease in 2017. It is estimated that around a third of the world’s population is infected with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2</a></span></sup> The prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is significantly lower than global numbers: in 2018, there were 9,000 new cases of active tuberculosis and 515 deaths due to the disease.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>3</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Tuberculosis is an airborne bacterial infection caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTBC) which typically affects the lungs. Tuberculosis is most commonly caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> but it can also be secondary to <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, which accounts for less than 1.6% of cases in North America.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>4</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>5</a></span></sup> In contrast, recent studies from Mexico noted a high prevalence and a rising trend of tuberculosis caused by <i>M. bovis</i>, representing up to 28.4% of cases in one study.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Live tubercle bacilli have the capacity of propagating through hematogenous and lymphatic spread to seed in lymph nodes, bones and kidneys.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> Multiple risk factors have been identified for extrapulmonary tuberculosis such as female gender, age above forty and patients with concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> Intraocular tuberculosis is a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and is more common in patients with HIV.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Intraocular tuberculosis accounts for 2% to 18% of extrapulmonary tuberculous (TB) manifestations.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> Tuberculosis has an increased propensity for tissues with high oxygen regional tension such as the choroid and the ciliary body. Uveitis represents the most common form of intraocular tuberculosis and has different presentations. Anterior uveitis is typically granulomatous and occurs in 12–36% of cases.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> Posterior uveitis accounts for 11–20% of cases of TB uveitis whereas panuveitis is more common, with 35–42% of cases.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> Posterior segment manifestations also include multifocal choroiditis,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>10</a></span></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>13</a></span></sup> serpiginous-like choroiditis,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>14</a></span></sup> chorioretinitis<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span></sup> and tuberculomas.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>15</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Endophthalmitis is a severe presentation of intraocular tuberculosis that progresses rapidly and that can lead to intraocular tissue destruction as well as globe perforation when the cornea or the sclera are involved (panophthalmitis). Given the scarcity of literature on the topic, we performed a systematic review to evaluate patient characteristics, clinical features, diagnostic tests and outcomes of patients with TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis.</p>

 <h2 id="_i7" class="section-heading-2">Methods</h2>
 <div id="s0002-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i8">Definitions and Eligibility Criteria</h3>
  <p>Case reports and case series reporting original data of endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis were included. Endogenous TB endophthalmitis was defined as purulent intraocular inflammation due to hematogenous spread of MTBC, with rapid progression. Panophthalmitis was defined as severe acute suppurative intraocular inflammation with extension to the cornea or sclera, secondary to endogenous spread of MTBC. A priori, to avoid excluding older studies, our definition of MTBC infection did not require a confirmed mycobacterial culture or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Rather, all cases that were reported as endogenous “TB endophthalmitis” or “panophthalmitis” by the original authors were included. Cases, that were not explicitly labeled as “endophthalmitis” or “panophthalmitis” by the original authors, meeting our definition were also included, after careful review of each case. Cases of multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis, chorioretinitis and tuberculomas without an associated rapidly progressive purulent panuveitis were excluded. Studies reporting post-operative and post-traumatic endophthalmitis and cases of non-tuberculous mycobacteria were excluded. We also excluded all pathological studies not including enough clinical information, studies that contained non-original data and those with no full-text available. Studies in languages other than English that could not be translated by the authors were also excluded.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0002-s2002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i9">Search Strategy</h3>
  <p>The systematic review was conducted in adherence with the PRISMA guidelines.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>16</a></span></sup> The databases were systematically searched from inception to August 1st 2020. References of relevant studies were also screened using the snowballing method.</p>
  <p>The MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted using the following terms: (Endophthalmitis [mh] OR panuveitis [mh] OR endophthalmitis [tiab] OR panophthalmitis [tiab]) AND (Tuberculosis [mh] OR Mycobacterium tuberculosis [mh] OR Mycobacterium bovis [mh] OR Tuberculosis [tiab] OR bovis [tiab] OR tuberc*).</p>
  <p>The EMBASE search was performed using the following headings: (exp endophthalmitis/OR exp panophthalmitis/OR panuveitis.mp. OR endophthalmitis.mp. OR panophthalmitis.mp.) AND (exp Mycobacterium tuberculosis/OR exp Mycobacterium bovis/OR exp tuberculosis/OR tuberculosis.mp. OR bovis.mp. OR tubercul*.mp.) NOT (“animal”/exp NOT “human”/exp).</p>
  <p>The Web of Science search strategy was the following: TS=(Endophthalmitis OR panophthalmitis OR panuveitis) AND TS=(Mycobacterium tuberculosis OR Mycobacterium bovis OR tuberculosis OR bovis OR tuberc*).</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0002-s2003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i10">Screening Process</h3>
  <p>References were imported into Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at <u class="uu"><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.covidence.org" target="_blank">www.covidence.org</a></u>) for screening and eligibility assessment. FA and SJ independently screened the titles and abstracts obtained using the abovementioned search strategy. Additional records identified through snowballing of reference lists were also screened. Full texts of studies that met the inclusion criteria or that needed further screening were examined independently. Disagreements were resolved through consultation and a final decision was taken by the senior author (MJA) when needed. When studies were excluded, reasons were clearly outlined.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0002-s2004" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">Data Collection</h3>
  <p>The following information was extracted from the included studies: authors’ names, year of publication, type of study (case series or case report), patient’s demographics (age and sex), past medical history (including history of tuberculosis), ocular and systemic symptoms on presentation, ocular examination findings on presentation, working diagnosis as reported by the authors, clinical evolution including medical and surgical treatments received, diagnostic tests including chest x-ray (CXR), chest computed tomography (CT), tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) results, final diagnosis, source and method of tuberculosis identification, and ocular morbidity and mortality outcomes. Quantitative data was presented by number of cases and occurrences with percentages. To handle missing data, a pairwise deletion approach (available-case analysis) was employed which allowed us to use the case when analyzing other non-missing variables.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>17</a></span></sup></p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i13">Study Selection and Characteristics</h3>
  <p><a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a> shows the PRISMA flow chart. The electronic search provided 1343 articles. Two hundred and seventy-six duplicates were identified by the systematic review software. Following title and abstract screening of 1067 studies, 1016 studies were excluded. Full-text eligibility assessment of 51 articles was performed. After exclusion of 25 full-text articles, 21 studies were deemed eligible and included in the study. The study characteristics are summarized in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>. Detailed case-by-case descriptions are available in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Tables 2</button> and <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0003">3</button>. There were 7 case series and 19 case reports. The earliest publication was from 1958 and the latest from 2019. There were 104 cases in the 26 studies. Only 44 cases were deemed eligible after careful case-by-case assessment of the case series.</p>

  <p>TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis had varied presentations in the available reports. Contralateral eye findings were reported in 34/44 cases. All cases of TB endophthalmitis or panophthalmitis involved a single eye per patient. However, in 4/34 cases (12%), the contralateral eye was affected to a lesser degree (eg, chorioretinal lesion) and/or was not diagnosed as “endophthalmitis” or “panophthalmitis” by the original authors, thereby not meeting our eligibility criteria and not included in the analysis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span></sup> There were no cases of bilateral TB endophthalmitis or panophthalmitis. <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0005">Table 5</button> summarizes the clinical characteristics and working diagnoses on presentation. The principal presenting symptoms were decreased vision (28/31, 90.3%), ocular pain or headache (18/31, 58.1%) and redness (10/31, 32.3%). Other symptoms included abnormal protrusion of the eye (2/31, 6.5%), floaters (2/31, 6.5%) and epibulbar mass (2/31, 6.5%). Symptom duration varied and a significant number of patients had symptoms for 1 to 3 months prior to presentation (15/30, 50.0%). Only 5/30 patients consulted within a week of symptom presentation (16.7%). Purulent intraocular inflammation was present in all cases and was a defining criterion for inclusion in this study. Other examination findings on initial presentation and during follow-up included: impaired ocular motility in 7/44 cases (15.9%), extraocular mass or scleral abscess in 7/44 cases (15.9%), high intraocular pressure or glaucoma in 6/44 cases (13.6%), spontaneous perforation in 3/44 cases (6.8%) and necrotizing retinitis in 2/44 cases (4.5%). Systemic symptoms like fever, chills or cough prior to presenting to the ophthalmology clinic were absent in half of the patients (50.0%). Visual acuities on presentation were generally poor: 23/27 (85.2%) had 20/200 vision or worse. Almost half of the patients (12/27, 44.4%) had no light perception (NLP) vision.</p>

  <p>One or multiple diagnostic interventions (total of 24) were obtained in 17/34 patients (50.0%). Among those, 13/24 (54.2%) interventions yielded a positive result. In the remaining 17 cases, the authors reported no diagnostic interventions before removal of the eye. A vitreous tap was obtained in 7/34 cases (20.6%) and an anterior chamber (AC) tap was performed in 5/34 cases (14.7%). Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was carried out in 8/34 cases (23.5%). Regarding diagnostic yield, comparing the different interventions, the rate of positivity was 1/7 (14.3%) for vitreous tap, 3/5 (60.0%) for AC tap and 7/8 (87.5%) for PPV. Case-by-case descriptions are detailed in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0003">Table 3</button>.</p>
  <p><button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0007">Table 7</button> describes the diagnostic yield of culture versus PCR in cases where both tests were performed.

Considering PCR as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of culture was 60.0% and 100%, respectively. There were 6 cases of positive PCR despite a negative culture and no instances of negative PCR despite a positive culture.</p>

Confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis occurred in 15/35 (42.8%) of cases, miliary tuberculosis in 7/35 cases (20.0%), CNS involvement in 2/35 cases (5.7%) and abdominal and peritoneal involvement in 2/35 cases (5.7%). There was 1 case of TB adrenalitis and 1 case of TB pericarditis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0037" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>37</a></span></sup> All patients were started on antituberculous treatment (ATT).

The eye was enucleated and pathology revealed Langerhans giant cells (LGCs) which can be found in both TB and syphilis. The TB etiology was therefore not recognized and the patient died 6 months after presentation from generalized tuberculosis. In the remaining cases, patients were either referred to as alive or no mention of death was made by authors.</p>

  <p><button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0008">Table 8</button> summarizes the best reported method of diagnosis and microbiologic findings. A TB etiology was confirmed on histopathologic specimen (HPS) after removal of the eye in 32/44 cases (72.7%). The earliest source of TB confirmation came from the vitreous (PPV or tap) in 6/44 cases (13.6%) and via an AC tap in 3/44 cases (6.8%). The studies reported a variety of microbiologic studies including microscopy to look for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and LGCs. Mycobacterial cultures, PCR and genomic deletion analysis were also used. Microscopy revealed AFB in 33/43 cases (76.7%) and LGCs only in 7/43 cases (16.3%). Mycobacterial cultures from vitreous, anterior chamber or HPS were reported in 18/43 cases (41.9%) and were positive in 14/18 cases (77.8%).

 <h2 id="_i22" class="section-heading-2">Discussion</h2>
 <p>Making the diagnosis of ocular TB is a challenge. There is a lack of comprehensive evidence on this topic and wide differences in institutional practices for the workup of patients.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>38</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0039" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>39</a></span></sup> In an effort to unify the diagnostic criteria for TB uveitis, the Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS-1) proposed in 2017 some diagnostic criteria based on a large multicentric retrospective study that included 1272 eyes.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0039" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>39</a></span></sup> Generally speaking, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to ocular TB is favoured, including a thorough combination of history, examination, and screening investigations including TST/IGRA and CXR. In addition to ocular signs, the diagnosis can be supported by extraocular findings.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>38</a></span></sup> The purpose of our study was to systematically review the available literature on endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis (severe subtypes of TB uveitis) in order to have a better understanding of the clinical features and evolution of the disease.</p>
 <p>Our review shows that endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis can present in every age group, ranging from infants to the elderly. The disease most commonly presented in immunocompetent individuals but it is worth noting that 25.0% of patients were immunocompromised. Previous studies have linked intraocular tuberculosis to HIV.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> In our cohort, concurrent HIV was seen in 16.7% of patients, with CD4 counts ranging from 34 to 263 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Most patients (63.2%) had no prior history of tuberculosis, making the ocular presentation the first manifestation of tuberculosis. Only 16.2% of patients had known active tuberculosis at presentation. Half of the patients did not report systemic symptoms like fever, chills or cough prior to presenting to the ophthalmology clinic. This highlights the importance of obtaining a thorough medical history from the patient, specially focused on risk factors such as the presence of immune disease, medication/drug use and at-risk behaviors. Even in the absence of systemic symptoms of tuberculosis or specific risk factors, a TB etiology must remain in the differential diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis.</p>
 <p>In our review, 50.0% of the patients presented relatively late, 1 to 3 months after the beginning of symptoms. This could be due to a variety of reasons including difficulty with access to care and inappropriate medical management prior to referral to the eye specialist who made the diagnosis. Another possibility is that this disease leads to a slow deterioration of vision associated with gradually increasing symptoms. The ocular symptoms were the driving reason for consultation. Decreased vision was reported by 90.3% of patients, pain by 58.1% of patients and redness by 32.3% of patients. Abnormal protrusion of the eye was reported by 6.5% of patients. Visual acuity on presentation was very poor with 85.2% of patients presenting with 20/200 or worse. Although bilateral presentation is frequent for ocular tuberculosis, there were only 4 reported cases of contralateral eye disease of lesser severity and no case of bilateral endophthalmitis or panophthalmitis. In parallel, follow-up durations were not rigorously reported in all studies. As such, we elected not to report them.</p>
 <p>In more than half of the cases (52.9%), the authors reported a presumptive diagnosis of endophthalmitis or panophthalmitis of unknown etiology, pending investigation. Before a definitive diagnosis was made, systemic antibiotics were prescribed in 47.6% of the reviewed cases. Corticosteroids alone were prescribed in 33.3% of cases without any antibiotic coverage. Current literature on endogenous endophthalmitis supports the initiation of treatment before a definitive diagnosis is made. Therapeutic approaches vary and the potential causative organism and extent of ocular involvement often direct the choice of therapy. Systemic antibiotics should have a wide spectrum of activity and very good ocular penetration.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>40</a></span></sup> In parallel, corticosteroids modulate the host inflammatory response to infection and have been shown to reduce tuberculosis-associated mortality when given in conjunction with ATT.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0041" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>41</a></span></sup> However, to our knowledge, there is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids without ATT or antibiotic coverage. In our experience and based on current practice guidelines, if systemic corticosteroids were to be started in the context of endogenous endophthalmitis, this should be done in conjunction with antibiotics and/or antivirals.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>42</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Retinoblastoma and other ocular malignancy were the presumptive diagnoses in 14.7% of cases.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>28</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>30</a></span></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>33</a></span></sup> In the report by McMoli et al, a 1-year-old boy presented with orbital cellulitis and an episcleral mass on the left eye. Retinoblastoma was suspected and the patient received external radiotherapy. TB panophthalmitis was only diagnosed after removal of the eye and examination of the histopathologic specimen. This is a prime example of how intraocular TB can mimic other diseases, in this case causing a delay in the initiation of appropriate ATT and exposing the child to unnecessary ionizing radiation and enucleation.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>32</a></span></sup> TB endophthalmitis can also mimic other infectious etiologies such as viral herpetic disease and toxoplasmosis, presenting as ARN. In the cases described by Antaki et al and by Rishi et al, peripheral retinal necrosis was seen along with panuveitis, prompting a diagnosis of ARN. In both cases, PCR on the vitreous samples confirmed the TB etiology.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Common investigations for endogenous endophthalmitis include CXR, CT scan, TST and/or IGRA. Abnormal chest imaging was seen in 70.4% of cases and this included any abnormal finding reported by the authors (miliary pattern, “lesion”, “active infection”, consolidation, etc.). In 3 cases, despite a normal initial CXR, further imaging with CT scan revealed a miliary pattern. A CXR alone is not sensitive enough to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis. If resources permit, CT scan of the chest should be obtained in all cases as it permits the detection of lesions even in cases with normal radiography.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0043" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>43</a></span></sup> A TST was positive in the majority of cases (60.0%) overall and in 4/9 (44.4%) of the immunocompromised individuals who underwent skin testing. However, a negative TST cannot rule out a TB etiology. A main cause for a false negative TST is anergy secondary to immunosuppression or disseminated tuberculosis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>44</a></span></sup> Repeat TST might be useful since conversion can occur along the disease course. IGRA testing was not widely reported possibly due to the lack of this technology at the time and place of publication in many the studied cases. Among the 4 cases where it was reported, one case showed a negative TST with a positive IGRA.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>25</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Diagnostic interventions were performed prior to the final outcome or removal of the eye in half of the patients. PPV was performed in 23.5% of cases and a vitreous tap was obtained alone or before PPV in 20.6% of cases. This finding is consistent with a large meta-analysis of endogenous endophthalmitis cases reported between 1986 and 2012 that revealed a 32% rate of PPV in that series.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>45</a></span></sup> It is important to note that the frequency and usefulness of PPV might be underestimated in our series since PPV is a relatively modern technique and access to a vitrectomy machine might not be readily available in every context. Regarding microbiological yield, vitreous specimens obtained during PPV had the highest yield with 87.5% of specimens returning positive for mycobacteria. Undiluted vitreous samples from vitreous taps were positive in only 14.3% of cases. Theoretically, since a greater sample of vitreous is obtained during PPV, the yield of PPV should be higher than the yield of vitreous tap. Consistent with our data, previous studies have shown that culturing contents of the vitrectomy cassette increases the likelihood of obtaining a positive culture compared to vitreous biopsy.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>46</a></span></sup> However, our data contrasts with the results of the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) that examined cases of post-operative bacterial endophthalmitis. In the EVS, PPV did not produce significantly more positive cultures than tap and the authors recommended against performing PPV solely to improve microbiological yield.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0047" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>47</a></span></sup> Possible explanations include differences in causative organisms, variations in PPV and vitreous tap techniques, as well as disparities in microbiologic analysis methods. Regarding the yield of mycobacterial PCR versus culture, our study shows that the sensitivity of cultures was not high enough (60.0%) to allow clinicians to rely on negative cultures for ruling out an intraocular TB infection. PCR appears to be more accurate than cultures in diagnosing intraocular TB. This is in keeping with previous studies showing high PCR positivity in cases of clinically suspected ocular TB.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0048" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>48</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0049" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>49</a></span></sup> However, this result needs to be interpreted with caution given the small sample size in our study. The COTS-1 Report 3 studied the real-world evidence on the utility of PCR of ocular fluids in the management of ocular TB.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>50</a></span></sup> It showed that PCR analysis still needs significant advancement to gain wider acceptability worldwide.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>50</a></span></sup> The report also demonstrated that PCR analysis may not influence management or treatment outcomes in the real-world scenario.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>50</a></span></sup> Regarding cost-effectiveness, previous studies looking at the diagnosis of pulmonary TB have demonstrated significant cost saving benefits of PCR versus mycobacterial culture.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0051" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>51</a></span></sup> From our study, no extrapolations can be made about the cost-effectiveness of those techniques for ocular fluid analysis. However, at our institution, the costs associated with mycobacterial culture of a specimen in the setting of suspicion of TB are 85.20 Canadian dollars, whereas the cost of direct PCR for mycobacteria is 72.00 Canadian dollars.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0052" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>52</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Systemic disease was frequently present in the reviewed cases. Pulmonary tuberculosis was reported in 42.8% of cases and miliary tuberculosis in 20.0% of cases. Other extraocular manifestations were reported but were not labeled as miliary tuberculosis. Those included: CNS, abdominal and peritoneal, pericardial and adrenal.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>19</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>21</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>27</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>28</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0031" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>31</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0037" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>37</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0053" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>53</a></span></sup> Treatment regimens varied from case-to-case and included medications like rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, among others. The reported mortality in this series was low (1 case) but this could be due to under-reporting as follow-up duration varied significantly from study to study. Rapid consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be made early to investigate systemic findings and manage the treatment.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span></sup> Caution should be exercised with ATT since isoniazid and ethambutol can both cause toxic optic neuropathies.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>54</a></span></sup> Those toxicities are usually dose-dependent and associated with prolonged used.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> Despite potential toxicity, those agents often cannot be stopped given the high mortality associated with disseminated infection and the paucity of efficient antituberculous agents in the case of CNS disease.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Ocular outcomes were generally very poor with 83.7% of cases requiring either enucleation, evisceration or exenteration. This is significantly higher than the reported rate of enucleation in cases of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis, as demonstrated in a large study of 2014 which reports a 20% enucleation rate.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>45</a></span></sup> This highlights the significant challenge associated with the diagnosis of TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis. This disease has no pathognomonic eye findings and can occur in apparently healthy individuals. Diagnosis is often delayed which can lead to profound visual and organ loss.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>38</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0055" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>55</a></span></sup> Starting ATT as early as possible might be beneficial to decrease vision loss and to prevent mortality. However, the decision to start empiric treatment in the absence of laboratory-based diagnosis remains difficult given the known toxicity associated with these medications. PPV has been shown to be beneficial in preserving vision and decreasing the likelihood of progression to enucleation in cases of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i24 _i25 _i26" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>45</a></span></sup> PPV might have the same benefits in cases of a TB etiology by providing an earlier diagnosis (highest diagnostic yield) and decreasing the infectious and inflammatory intraocular load.</p>
 <p>Our study has several limitations. First, the data were gathered only from case reports and case series which are known to have selection and publication bias. We report poor ocular outcomes associated with endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis, but we recognize that severe cases are more likely to be reported by authors. We performed a quantitative analysis of the extracted data but our results could not produce relative association measures. This is an intrinsic limitation of the methodology of systematic reviews of case reports and case series, due to the heterogeneity of the data. To counter missing data and to study the highest numbers of clinical characteristics, we performed available-case analysis. The total number of observations varied between parameters and, in some cases, the sample sizes were small. As such, some of the results must be interpreted with caution. While not all the included reports relied on a molecular diagnosis of MTBC, all efforts were made to only incorporate studies describing cases compatible with hematogenous spread of tuberculosis. Our analysis captured the heterogeneity of the management of TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis which is affected by the availability of technologies and resources at the time of publication (eg, IGRA, CT scan and PPV). Despite these limitations, we believe that our results can be useful to ophthalmologists as they can get a better appreciation of this rare condition. To our knowledge, this is the largest comprehensive review of endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis.</p>

 <h2 id="_i23" class="section-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>We can make the following conclusions and recommendations based on the results of this study as well as our clinical experience. In patients presenting with endogenous endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis of unknown etiology: (1) maintaining a high index of suspicion for tuberculosis is required to provide timely diagnosis and management (evidence: study results); (2) a thorough medical history should be obtained with a focus on prior history of tuberculosis, immunosuppression and medication use (evidence: study results); (3) CT scan of the chest should be considered even in cases with a normal initial CXR, and orbital/cerebral imaging should be considered as well (evidence: study results); (4) mycobacterial cultures and PCR should be done on every vitreous specimen obtained in the context of an infection if the vitreal sample volume permits and especially in unusual cases and in patients coming from endemic areas (evidence: clinical experience). In patients with confirmed TB endophthalmitis/panophthalmitis, we recommend: (1) prompt consultation with an infectious disease specialist to investigate for systemic disease even in the absence of generalized symptoms (evidence: study results); (2) testing for HIV after discussion with the patient since tuberculosis and HIV frequently occur together (evidence: study results); (3) after the initiation of ATT, monitoring for potential medication-induced optic neuropathy (evidence: clinical experience); and (4) given the grim ocular prognosis and to strengthen the patient-doctor therapeutic alliance, patients should be counselled early on the high likelihood of permanent vision and organ loss despite maximal therapy (evidence: clinical experience and study results).</p>
