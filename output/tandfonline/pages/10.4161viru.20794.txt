 <p>The nematode <i>C. elegans</i> has emerged as a powerful in vivo platform for studies of the innate immune response. <i>C. elegans</i> can be infected with a wide variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens that interact with both intestinal and epidermal epithelial cells. The natural fungal pathogen <i>Drechmeria coniospora</i> infects <i>C. elegans</i> by first adhering to the cuticle and then extending invasive hyphae that penetrate the cuticle and grow into the underlying hypodermal epithelial cells. This infection process leads to activation of the worm’s innate immune response, which involves the transcriptional upregulation of many genes, including several proposed antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including the neuropeptide-like protein (<i>nlp</i>) and caenicin (<i>cnc</i>) family of genes.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R1" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>1</sup></a></span> The expression of many <i>nlp</i> and <i>cnc</i> genes is regulated by a well-conserved p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R2" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>2</sup></a></span> although the most distal parts of this pathway that detect the pathogen and activate p38 MAP kinase signaling are not well defined.</p>
 <p>Previous studies have characterized the transcriptional response of <i>C. elegans</i> to <i>D. coniospora</i> infection.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R3" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>3</sup></a></span> To gain additional insights, Couillault et al.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R4" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>4</sup></a></span> used a comparative proteomics approach to identify host proteins whose abundance in specific subcellular fractions was altered upon infection. Among the proteins identified, HSP-3 representation was increased upon infection whereas representation of its homolog HSP-4 was not. <i>hsp-3</i> and <i>hsp-4</i> encode the worm of orthologs of mammalian BiP/GRP78, which, unlike <i>C. elegans</i>, is encoded by a single gene.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R5" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>5</sup></a></span> BiP encodes an ER resident protein chaperone with two roles in the UPR. First, BiP regulates UPR signaling via interactions with the ER stress sensors ATF6, PERK and IRE1. Second, BiP is a transcriptional target of the UPR and therefore acts in a feedback loop to regulate UPR activity and restore ER homeostasis.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R6" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>6</sup></a></span> Although <i>C. elegans hsp-3</i> and <i>hsp-4</i> also share these roles,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R7" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>7</sup></a></span> previous studies have been unable to functionally differentiate these two genes. Using genetics approaches, Couillault et al. provide the first data demonstrating functional differences in <i>hsp-3</i> and <i>hsp-4</i>. They find that <i>hsp-3</i>, but not <i>hsp-4</i>, is required to activate AMP expression following <i>D. coniospora</i> infection. Interestingly, <i>hsp-3</i> was not required for AMP expression following induction by other stressors, including physical wounding or hyperosmotic stress. Therefore, <i>hsp-3</i> has a specific functional role in the regulation of infection-induced pathways controlling AMP expression. The mechanism(s) by which <i>hsp-3</i> contributes to innate immune signaling remains unresolved. Whether such a mechanism involves exotic cytoplasmic functions of this typically ER localized chaperone or more typical chaperone-client protein regulatory interactions will require additional studies to determine.</p>
 <p>Most previous studies in <i>C. elegans</i> have investigated the role of the UPR in response to stressors delivered to the intestine, such as pore-forming toxins or intestine colonizing bacteria.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R8" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>8</sup></a></span><sup>,</sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R9" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>9</sup></a></span> The findings by Couillault represent one of the first non-intestinal stress-responsive roles described for the UPR in <i>C. elegans</i>. One interesting observation made by the authors is that treatment of larval, but not adult, worms with the UPR inducer tunicamycin (as well as other ER stressors like DTT) activated expression of the AMP reporter transgene <i>nlp-29::GFP</i> in the hypodermis. Why might generic ER stress act in such a developmentally and tissue-restricted manner to activate AMP levels? One possibility is that <i>D. coniospora</i> places a proteotoxic burden on the hypodermal secretory system, perhaps via massive biosynthesis of AMPs or as a compensatory attempt to repair/replace widespread damage to the hypodermal membrane or extracellular matrix. However, this load only exceeds ER folding capacity in larval animals because it occurs contemporaneously with the synthesis of the new cuticle, when many secretory proteins (i.e., collagens) are being produced. Given this massive secretory load in larval animals, UPR inducers, such as tunicamycin, may therefore exceed the folding capacity of the secretory pathway in larval animals, but not in adults, which have a lower secretory burden. In this respect, the UPR may be an important “sensor” of infection in larvae but not in adults. Further work is needed to unravel which UPR pathways may be important for activation of AMP gene expression during this potentially vulnerable developmental window.</p>
 <p>The findings of Couillault and colleagues raise several interesting questions that need to be further addressed in order to understand the role of <i>hsp-3</i> in the antimicrobial signaling pathway. Indeed, the genetic interactions presented in the manuscript position <i>hsp-3</i> downstream of <i>nipi-3</i> and upstream of <i>tpa-1</i>. However HSP-3, an ER luminal protein, is not likely to interact with those proteins in the cytosol (see <a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>), a possibility noted by Couillault et al. A more likely possibility is that HSP-3 regulates the folding, maturation, or processing of one or more client proteins whose activity is required for the Nipi signaling pathway (<a href="#F1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>). A prediction of this model is that inhibition of such a HSP-3 client protein(s) should produce a Nipi phenotype. Perhaps upon <i>D. coniospora</i> infection, the innate immune response elicits major demands on the secretory pathway to bring specific proteins to the cell surface as an adaptive response, and increased HSP-3 abundance/activity is required to meet such demands. Interestingly, <i>hsp-3</i> has not been found to be upregulated in previous transcriptional studies of <i>D. coniospora</i> infection,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="R3" data-reflink="_i2" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>3</sup></a></span> suggesting that this mechanism may involve regulation of HSP-3 function via post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as altered protein stability, subcellular localization or post-translational modification(s). Further studies will be required to distinguish among these possibilities.</p>

 <p>In conclusion, Couillault et al. have identified an unexpected and specific role for <i>hsp-3</i> in the regulation of the innate immune signaling pathway. Such roles might only be differentiated in <i>C. elegans</i>, where the functional redundancy between BiP homologs permits such a separation of function. Going forward, it will be important to determine if BiP plays similar functional roles in the vertebrate innate immune response to pathogen infection.</p>
