 <p>A large body of knowledge has been accumulated for the tiny worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> since it was chosen as a model organism by Brenner 50&nbsp;y ago.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>1</sup></a></span> <i>C. elegans</i>, first described by Maupas at the start of the last century,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>2</sup></a></span> is a free-living nematode, 1&nbsp;mm long, found in rotting fruit. In the lab it can easily be grown on agar petri dishes or in liquid culture. Being a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, it can be expanded as a clonal population, but males can also be maintained, allowing genetic approaches to be undertaken. With a short life cycle of 3&nbsp;days, and 300 progeny per adult, large homogenous populations can be generated easily. Its transparency facilitates live imaging, very useful for cell biological studies. <i>C. elegans</i> has a simple anatomy with less than 1000 cells organized in a small number of tissues and internal organs.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
 <p>In <i>C. elegans</i>, as in mammals, the epidermis acts as a barrier to protect the organism from environmental damage and pathogens, prevents leakage of internal molecules and blocks the entrance of foreign compounds. Unlike the multilayered stratified epithelium in mammals, the adult <i>C. elegans</i> epidermis (also termed “hypodermis” for historical reasons) is mainly composed of one cell layer, including a large syncytial cell, called hypodermal cell 7 (hyp7), which surrounds the worm and covers most of the body length, and a line of specialized lateral cells on each side of the worm, called the seam cells (<a href="#f0001"><b>Fig.&nbsp;1</b></a>).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>

 <p>As in most invertebrates, <i>C. elegans</i> possesses an exoskeleton. In nematodes, this is a tough, but flexible external cuticle secreted by the epidermis. This collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) maintains the integrity of the worm, defines the body shape of the animal and is required for locomotion, through its attachment to the underlying muscles. The cuticle is subdivided into basal, medial and cortical zones, overlaid by the epicuticle and the most external layer, the surface coat. While the cuticle is mainly composed of collagen and insoluble proteins, called cuticlins, the epicuticle and the surface coat are rich in lipids and structural glycoproteins such as mucins, respectively. Secreted non-structural proteins also likely make up an important part of the cuticle, such as enzymes involved in post-secretion modification and cross-linking of matrix proteins or structural proteins associated with the surface coat.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005 cit0006" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>5,6</sup></a></span> In mammals, the most external layer of the skin, the <i>stratum corneum</i> (SC) is the final product of keratinocyte differentiation, resulting from denucleation and crosslinking of intracellular proteins.

 <h2 id="_i4" class="section-heading-2">Cuticle Collagen: A Key Component in Barrier Integrity</h2>
 <p>Collagen is the main structural protein of the extracellular matrix in animals, and the most abundant protein in mammals. It is an essential component of the skin and plays a key role in organogenesis and body morphology. In <i>C. elegans</i>, 2 major collagen families are present, the cuticle and the basement membrane collagens. While only 3 genes encodes type IV and type XVIII basement membrane collagens, the cuticle collagens are encoded by more than 170 genes. They are most similar to the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) found in vertebrates.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>5</sup></a></span> They are regulated differentially, most of them following the 4 molting cycles during larval development and are involved in the formation of distinct sub-cuticle structures (e.g. annular furrows and alae) and layers.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>9</sup></a></span> Collagen biogenesis involves a complex maturation process, partially shared between nematodes and vertebrates, during which pro-collagen undergoes several co-translational and post-translational modifications. Collagen maturation ends with the secretion of collagen triple helices that are covalently cross-linked via tyrosine residues. This determines the characteristic stiffness and integrity of the worm cuticle.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>5</sup></a></span> During this step, a peroxidase (MLT-7) cooperates with an NADPH dual oxidase (BLI-3), to promote reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated catalysis of di- and tri- tyrosine covalent bonds.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010 cit0011" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>10,11</sup></a></span> Recently, a tetraspanin protein (TSP-15) was found to form a complex with BLI-3/DUOX and MLT-7/peroxidase and to be required for ROS generation.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0012" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>12</sup></a></span> In the absence of any one of these 3 proteins, no di- and tri- tyrosine bonds are made and the cuticle is fragile and blistered. In vertebrates, the formation of covalent cross-links of proteins such as involucrin and loricrin in the SC is also essential for the function of mammalian skin as an external barrier. It occurs via the action of transglutaminases that leads to the oxidation of amino group of lysine or glutamate residues into aldehyde derivatives. Collagen helices are cross-linked by lysyl oxidase in vertebrates between lysine and hydroxyl lysine residues. Lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linkages are not found in the <i>C. elegans</i> cuticle, they only contribute to cross-linking of type IV collagen in the basement membrane.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013 cit0014" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>13,14</sup></a></span></p>
 <p>In human skin, collagens are mainly found in the dermis. Many mutations in different collagen genes have been associated with various diseases.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>15</sup></a></span> For example, patients with <i>epidermolysis bullosa</i>, carry mutations in <i>COL7A1</i> or <i>COL17A1</i> that lead to blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, and mutations in <i>COL3A1</i> or <i>COL5A1</i> have been found in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, with various symptoms including a fragile skin.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016 cit0017" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>16,17</sup></a></span> Similarly, in nematodes, mutations in genes encoding collagens, like DPY-9, ROL-6, BLI-1, or processing enzymes, including the prolyl 4-hydroxylase DPY-18 or the disulfide isomerase PDI-2, result in diverse body morphology defects described as ROLler (Rol: helical twisting of the animal's body), DumPY (Dpy: shortening in the body length), or BLIster (Bli: blistering of cuticle material away from the surface of the animal).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
 <p>The nematode cuticle is made of successive layers of different collagens. Interestingly, some mutants in specific collagen genes, such as <i>dpy-2</i>, <i>dpy-7</i> or <i>dpy-10,</i> which are presumed to be the most external collagens of the cuticle, show high osmotic resistance, due to a higher internal level of glycerol. These same collagens are also required for proper circumferential furrow formation.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>18</sup></a></span> Wheeler and Thomas proposed that these collagens on the furrows could act as a stretch sensor, monitoring the turgor pressure of the cuticle. OSM-7 and OSM-11, which are nematode-specific proteins structurally related to the Notch ligand Delta, possibly associated with the cuticle, could transduce the signal, leading to the increase in glycerol.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>18</sup></a></span> The same mutants also show a constitutive activation of innate immunity (see below).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019 cit0020" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>19,20</sup></a></span> As previous studies found these mutants to be involved in the suppression of diverse hypomorphic mutations, probably through the induction of chaperone function,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021 cit0022 cit0023 cit0024" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>21-24</sup></a></span> these results suggest that some collagens are part of a general stress sensing mechanism.</p>

 <h2 id="_i5" class="section-heading-2">Epidermal Wounding: Cell Autonomous Innate and Healing Response</h2>
 <p>Just as mutation of genes required for the proper development of the worm's cuticle can trigger an innate immune response, so too does directly wounding the worm. This can be done either by hand, with a fine glass needle, when the worm is pricked at the tail, or in a more controlled manner with a laser that enables precise wounding of the epidermis. In both cases, at the wound site there is an immediate deposition of as-yet uncharacterized autofluorescent material that perdures for many hours. Later, the secretion of basal cuticle components leads to the repair of the damaged cuticle, leaving a scar at the wound site. Moreover, injury provokes a rapid induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression in the epidermis. For example a rise in the expression of <i>nlp-29</i> is detectable within one hour after injury and is sustained for several hours (<a href="#f0002"><b>Fig.&nbsp;2A</b></a>).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>20</sup></a></span> This induction of innate effectors upon wounding is not due to microbe invasion but is a preventive response of the tissues, as previously shown in other species.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>25</sup></a></span> Indeed, mutants that are defective for the induction of defense gene expression upon wounding succumb to opportunistic infections.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>

 <p>In order to identify the first event which initiates the epidermal response to damage, Xu and Chisholm focused their attention on calcium signaling, as it was already known to be involved in embryonic wound healing and the response to membrane injury in single cells.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027 cit0028" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>27,28</sup></a></span> Upon injury to the epidermal syncytium, an immediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave, released from internal stores, can be detected at the wound site and provokes local formation of a dense actin ring which, in turn, will trigger complete wound closure in 24 hrs. This epidermal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response involves the epidermal transient receptor potential channel, metastatin family (TRPM) GTL-2, the Gα<sub>q</sub> EGL-30 and its effector PLCβ EGL-8.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29</sup></a></span> Subsequently it was shown that specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into the mitochondria close to the wound site leads to local mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production and that mtROS release inhibits the Rho GTPase RHO-1, promoting actin polymerization and filopodial-like protrusion in a Cdc-42 and Arp2/3 dependent manner.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029 cit0030" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29,30</sup></a></span> This wound closure process is different from the most common Rho GTPase-dependent purse-string mechanism that occurs, for instance, after wounding in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0031" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>31</sup></a></span></p>
 <p>While the pathways leading either to wound healing or AMP production (see below) are genetically and mechanistically distinct,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>29</sup></a></span> the worm homolog of the tumor suppressor death-associated protein kinase, DAPK-1, functions as a negative regulator of both barrier repair and AMP expression. Loss of function of <i>dapk-1</i> leads to spontaneous cuticle hypertrophy with associated appearance of autofluorescent aggregates and to the constitutive upregulation of epidermal AMPs.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>26</sup></a></span> Thus as for other immune responses, the epidermal response to damage has to be tightly regulated to prevent the deleterious consequences of chronic activation.</p>

 <h2 id="_i7" class="section-heading-2">Pathogen Infection</h2>
 <p>While some pathogens will only passively enter the host through a wound, others have developed active ways to infect the worm through the cuticle. The nematophagous fungus <i>Lecanicillium psalliotae</i> is able to degrade the worm cuticle by secreting a serine protease, thus facilitating mycelia penetration and complete nematode degradation.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>32</sup></a></span> Other fungi, such as <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i>, <i>Drechslerella stenobrocha</i> and <i>Dactylellina ellipsospora</i>, are able to form traps to capture, kill and digest worms as a food source.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>33</sup></a></span> One of the most studied pathogens able to infect the worms via its cuticle is <i>Drechmeria coniospora</i>.

 <p>Fungi and bacteria take advantage of the carbohydrate-rich surface coat and are believed to use lectins to adhere to the nematode cuticle. Recent studies in <i>C. elegans</i> have identified mutants with defects in their surface coat carbohydrates and an increased adhesion of <i>D. coniospora.</i> For instance, the <i>bus-2</i> mutant carries a mutation in the enzyme galactosyltransferase and is enriched in core-2 fucosyl <i>O</i>-glycans at the expense of core-1 glycans, suggesting that there is an increase in fucose exposure in this mutant.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040 cit0041" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>40,41</sup></a></span> Moreover a fucose-specific lectin binds the vulva of wild-type worms, a preferential site for <i>D. coniospora</i> adhesion. Taken together, these results suggest that fucosyl glycans are a target for the binding of <i>D. coniospora</i> spores.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>42</sup></a></span></p>
 <p>It is interesting to note that if mutants like <i>bus-2</i> have an increased adhesion to <i>D. coniospora</i>, they conversely have a reduced adhesion to the bacterial pathogen <i>M. nematophilum</i>, hence their name <i>Bus</i> for bacterial unswollen.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0043" data-reflink="_i14 _i16 _i17" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span><sup>43</sup></a></span> The same opposite effect has been revealed with 2 different strains of <i>Leucobacter spp</i> Verde.

 <p>After <i>D. coniospora</i> infection or wounding, the expression of <i>nlp</i> genes is induced by the activation of a G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) DCAR-1 in an epidermis-specific and cell-autonomous way (<a href="#f0002"><b>Fig.&nbsp;2B</b></a>). DCAR-1 is expressed in the apical part of the epidermal syncytium (hyp7) and is activated by HPLA (4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid).

In mutants defective for muscle contraction, GIT-1 progressively leaves HDs.

 <h2 id="_i13" class="section-heading-2">Conclusions</h2>
 <p><i>C. elegans</i> lacks both an adaptive immune system and specialized immune cells. This obviously limits its relevance for the understanding of human immunity. On the other hand, its relative simplicity and the extensive range of available experimental methods facilitate its use in biology. The major molecular mechanisms involved in the epidermal innate immune response in <i>C. elegans</i> have been identified. As in humans, they involve the upregulation of AMP expression and wound healing, governed by a combination of highly conserved and nematode-specific pathways. A common theme that has emerged is the importance of damage recognition as a trigger for the induction of defense genes. Future studies should reveal the mechanisms leading to the production and/or release of DAMPs and the identity of the elusive “fungus-receptor” putatively responsible for triggering pathogen-specific innate immune defenses. Together with a better understanding of how cross-tissue communication contributes to the regulation of host immunity, this will lead to a more comprehensive insight into how an organism can re-establish homeostasis after the integrity of epithelial barriers has been compromised by injury or infection.</p>
