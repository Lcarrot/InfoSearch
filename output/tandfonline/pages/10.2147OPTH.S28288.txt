 <p>Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0001" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1</a></span></sup> The number of persons affected is estimated to be in the region of 66.8 million with 6.7 million blind.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0002" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2</a></span></sup> This disorder is characterized by progressive optic neuropathy eventually leading to loss of central vision and total blindness in its final stages. A population study in Ghana reported that POAG affects 7.7% and 8.5% of people 30 and 40 years of age, respectively<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0003" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>3</a></span></sup> whereas 1.9% of Americans over 40 years of age are reported affected.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0004" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>4</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Established risk factors for POAG in Ghanaian patients include elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a family history, old age, and African ancestry.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0003" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>3</a></span></sup> Recent studies in Ghana have also identified late presentation and a delay in diagnosis as significant risk factors.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0005" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>5</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0006" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span></sup> Treatment consists of lowering the IOP through medical or surgical methods. <sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0007" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span></sup> As of 2004, there are 45 ophthalmologists practicing in Ghana, or approximately one per 500,000 persons.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0008" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>8</a></span></sup> The majority of these physicians practice in the outpatient setting near the capital city of Accra. Patients in this practice setting are the focus of this manuscript.</p>
 <p>This study aims to describe and compare two POAG patient groups at separate stages of disease severity for associations between clinical findings including IOP, cup-to-disk ratio (CDR), CDR asymmetry, age, visual acuity (VA) and Humphrey visual field (HVF) mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation (PSD).</p>

<div id="S0006" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec-type_methods NLM_sec_level_1">
 <h2 id="_i7" class="section-heading-2">Methods</h2>
 <p>This was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 164 patient charts reviewed at the Emmanuel Eye Clinic, a large outpatient eye clinic in Accra, Ghana with an annual volume that exceeds 30,000 patients. Data were gathered from the patients’ initial visits prior to initiation of medical therapy.</p>
 <div id="S0006-S2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i8">Inclusion criteria</h3>
  <p>Two broad patient groups were formed and defined according to modified International Geographical and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology (ISGEO) POAG criteria (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0001">Table 1</button>).<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0009" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>9</a></span></sup> The first group was defined as having moderate glaucoma, with clinical findings showing disk cupping (CDR 0.7–0.8) without a visual field defect (VFD) or a CDR &lt; 0.7 with a confirmed VFD. The second group was defined as having advanced glaucoma, with clinical findings showing either advanced structural and functional damage (CDR &gt; 0.7 with a confirmed VFD) or advanced optic nerve atrophy (CDR &gt; 0.9) with or without satisfactory HVF results. Eligible patients included those ≥30 years old with a diagnosis of POAG on record, no past diagnosis or treatment for glaucoma or ocular hypertension elsewhere and no history or clinical evidence for a secondary or congenital cause of glaucoma.</p>

  <p>All patients had received at the initial visit a comprehensive slit-lamp examination, Goldmann applanation tonometry (Haag-Streit, Mason, OH), gonioscopy, and 24-2 HVF at their initial presentation. Only reliable HVF results were included in this study. We chose to base a patient’s IOP on the average of two consecutive measurements taken from the patient chart prior to initiation of any medical therapy.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="S0006-S2002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i9">Main outcome measures</h3>
  <p>Patient groups were described and compared. Comparisons include age, gender, IOP, CDR, CDR asymmetry, HVF MD/PSD values and VA results. All VA data were recorded from a standard Snellen chart at 20 feet (6 m) and converted to logMAR format for standardized comparisons. Associations were derived using odds ratio (OR) comparisons. The moderate group functioned as the control.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="S0006-S2003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i10">Definitions</h3>
  <p>A VFD was determined by Humphrey computer-based automated perimetry, meaning positive results of hemi-meridional analyses of threshold tests and/or the presence of one or more absolute defects in the central 30° as tested with the full threshold strategy 24-2 (central 54 points, two zone strategy) with ophthalmologic interpretation used for definitive diagnosis of glaucomatous field loss.</p>

 <div id="S0006-S2004" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">Exclusion criteria</h3>
  <p>Secondary or congenital causes of glaucoma were excluded from this study. Patients with prior trabeculectomy or medically controlled IOPs were excluded. A retinal disease that may cause visual field defects or macular disease which significantly impairs central vision was an exclusion criterion. Patients with closed angles on gonioscopy were diagnosed as angle closure glaucoma and excluded.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i12">Data analysis</h3>
  <p>For one eye’s data analysis (oculus dexter [OD] or oculus sinister [OS]), the two-sample <i>t</i>-test was applied to compare mean age, IOP, CDR, CDR asymmetry, MD/PSD and VA in logMAR between groups. Ordinal logistic regression was used in the comparison of VA when it was treated as ordinal data. For both eyes’ data combined, the mixed model was used to account for between-eye correlations. The mixed model was also applied to assess correlations between MD and other risk factors when treating them as continuous variables. The associations of age ≥65 years and IOP (worse IOP of two eyes ≥31 mmHg) with advanced glaucoma were assessed by calculating ORs via logistic regression models. Gender distribution difference between groups was done by the Chi-square test. The comparison of risk factors across groups defined by MD values was done using analysis of variance.</p>

 <h2 id="_i13" class="section-heading-2">Results</h2>
 <p>Basic demographics of moderate and advanced POAG groups are shown in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0002">Table 2</button>. Of 164 charts included, 90 (54.9%) were advanced POAG patients and 74 (45.1%) were moderate POAG patients. The mean age for all patients was 57.66 years with a standard deviation of 15.03 years. There was no significant difference in age between subject groups (<i>P</i> = 0.10). There was a highly significant difference in the gender distribution between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.0096). The proportion of males in the advanced group was higher than that in the moderate group (63.3% vs 40.5%).</p>

 <p>A higher percentage of patients in the advanced group were older than 65 years. All six patients older than 80 years of age had advanced POAG. The OR of having advanced POAG between patients older or younger than 65 years was OR = 1.70 (0.90–3.25), which is not statistically significant.</p>
 <p>Clinical findings are summarized in <button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0003">Table 3</button>. Advanced patients had significantly higher mean IOP on initial presentation in both eyes (OD: 30.93 vs 25.94 mmHg, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01; OS: 32.37 vs 26.42 mmHg, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). The OR of being an advanced glaucoma patient with IOP ≥ 31 mmHg versus IOP ≤ 30 mmHg was higher than for moderate patients (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.17–4.29). Increasing IOP also correlated with increasing CDR (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>). Nearly 95% of patients with an IOP ≥ 40 mmHg had a CDR ≥ 0.7. This correlation was significant for men and women in both eyes (OD <i>P</i> = 0.01; OS <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Mean CDR was larger in advanced patients (0.85 vs 0.58, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and mean CDR asymmetry was also greater (0.14 vs 0.05, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>

 <p>Advanced patients had poorer visual acuity in both eyes (<button class="ref showTableEventRef" data-id="T0004">Table 4</button>). There was no significant difference in the number of patients with 20/20 correctable vision for either group, however, more advanced patients met or exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for legal blindness (&gt;20/200 VA) in at least one eye. When treating visual acuities measured from the Snellen chart as ordinal data (20/20 → NLP) a difference was found in both eyes (OD <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; OS <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Comparing VA converted to logMAR averages that excluded hand motion (HM), light perception (LP), and no light perception (NLP) for each eye showed a significant difference in OD (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), but not in OS (<i>P</i> = 0.61). Poor vision was more often unilateral than bilateral: Less than 20% of advanced patients and only one moderate patient had VA &gt; 20/200 oculi uterque (OU).</p>

 <h2 id="_i17" class="section-heading-2">Discussion</h2>
 <p>This study compares two distinct primary open angle glaucoma patient groups defined according to clinical disease severity for important associations between common risk factors. Patient groups were defined according to modified ISGEO criteria and included a relatively equal number with no significant differences in age or ancestry.</p>
 <p>Herndon et al identified in a previous outpatient survey of 198 glaucoma patients in Ghana that the most common form of glaucoma was primary open-angle glaucoma (44.2%) followed by POAG suspects (30.5%) with chronic angle-closure glaucoma being rare (6.6%).<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0006" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>6</a></span></sup> Our study sought to compare associations between moderate and advanced POAG patients that closely resembled POAG and POAG suspect groups in that study. In choosing to define one group as having moderate glaucoma versus glaucoma suspects, we took into account that all patients in our study were receiving active glaucoma therapy and were being treated clinically as a continuum from moderate to severe disease. It is possible that a small group of “nonprogressers” were included in the moderate glaucoma group. Even so, it is not possible to isolate a group of glaucoma suspects who are all nonprogressers either for comparison purposes with advanced patients. Using modified ISGEO classification is a reasonable alternative to define glaucoma patients with moderate stage disease at high risk for progression to advanced disease.</p>
 <p>The mean age of glaucoma patients in our study was 57.66 years which is similar to the average age in many other studies carried out in African populations.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0010" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>10</a></span></sup> These include studies in St Lucia,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0011" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>11</a></span></sup> Barbados,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0012" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>12</a></span></sup> Tanzania,<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0013" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>13</a></span></sup> and South Africa.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0014" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>14</a></span></sup> Direct comparisons with these population studies are difficult considering our smaller sample size and focus only on the outpatient clinical practice. While the vast majority of glaucoma patients that receive care do so in the outpatient setting, the vast majority of patients with glaucoma in Ghana are not receiving treatment so our findings cannot be applied to the population at large. We can conclude from our results that most cases of POAG at this outpatient site occur in patients older than 50 years of age.</p>
 <p>Other studies, notably the early glaucoma manifest trial (EGMT), provide convincing evidence that POAG increases with age.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0015" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>15</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0016" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>16</a></span></sup> The EGMT showed an increase in prevalence of POAG with age with less than 1% of patients &lt;65 years old affected, to approximately 1% at 70 years, and well over 3% at 75 years. The St Lucia and Barbados cohorts both showed a steady increase in age-associated prevalence. The major population study in Ghana reported that POAG affects 7.7% and 8.5% of people 30 and 40 years of age, respectively. <sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0003" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>3</a></span></sup> These figures are expected to increase as life expectancy increases in Ghana and will pose an increasing burden on eye care services in the outpatient setting.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0017" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>17</a></span></sup></p>
 <p>Elevated IOP is currently thought of as a major risk factor and no longer the defining characteristic of POAG.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0007" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>7</a></span></sup> There is some evidence to show cyclical fluctuations in IOP occur during a 24-hour day.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0018" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>18</a></span></sup> Results are conflicting as to whether these fluctuations, measured in terms of the standard deviation for multiple office measures, lead to progression of POAG.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0019" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>19</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0020" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>20</a></span></sup> For this study IOP was recorded as the average of two consecutive measurements taken from the patient chart prior to medical therapy. We feel that the accuracy of our definitions and findings were increased using this method.</p>
 <p>In a previous case-control study in Ghana, glaucoma progression was determined to be most strongly correlated with IOP &gt; 30 mmHg and a family history.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0005" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>5</a></span></sup> Our study supports this conclusion, however we can only draw associations from our findings without any temporal relationship between the two POAG groups. We further show a strong association between HVF MD values as independent predictors of POAG progression and pre-treatment IOP. MD greater than −12 dB is strongly associated with POAG stage and elevated IOP in this study.</p>
 <p>Our study identified a significant difference in optic nerve asymmetry between the moderate and advanced glaucoma groups (<i>P</i> = 0.001) which indicates more severe unilateral optic neuropathy than bilateral optic neuropathy in these patients. It is not clear if this corresponds with our VA results which showed a significant difference in visual acuity between patient groups in OD only. What is clear is a high number of patients in the advanced POAG group met criteria for WHO blindness (VA &gt; 20/200) which suggests the advanced POAG had affected central visual acuity more frequently in this patient group. Bilateral VA &gt; 20/200 was uncommon. This appears to suggest VA is a poor predictor of early POAG progression, but a better predictor of late optic nerve damage. Wilson et al supported this finding by showing evidence that the deterioration of visual acuity correlated with faster progression of POAG in black populations. <sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0021" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>21</a></span></sup> In comparisons of VA between groups, there was a discrepancy in OS when compared as logMAR integers. This is accounted for by the fact that a higher number of patients with HM, LP, or NLP in OS were omitted as these visual acuities do not correspond to a specific logMAR integer. Consequently the logMAR VA analysis result with missing information was less significant than the analysis using ordinal data.</p>
 <p>Central corneal thickness is associated with IOP and progression of POAG.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0022" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>22</a></span>,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0023" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>23</a></span></sup> Corneas thinner than 520 μm display lower IOPs, whereas thicker corneas display higher IOPs. Pachymetry testing was not available at this clinic. Reduced central cornea thickness has been reported in Black populations.<sup><span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="CIT0024" data-reflink="_i20 _i21" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>24</a></span></sup> Pachymetry testing may have led to a further elevation of IOP results in this study.</p>
 <p>We are the first to report in a West African population a strong positive predictive ratio between estimation of CDR and HVF MD and PSD results. A significant implication of this finding is that it encourages clinicians in Ghana to utilize automated perimetry testing as part of the standard glaucoma work up and provides a measure of assurance to clinicians unable to obtain a clear view of the optic nerve head due to a variety of factors or those treating POAG suspects who present with normal IOP. Although CDR is less diagnostic in comparison to newer imaging modalities such as ocular coherence tomography (OCT) and Heidelberg retinal tomography (HRT), it still has a role in identifying patients at risk for POAG progression in resource poor clinical settings, especially when combined with HVF automated perimetry and the identification of a clear optic nerve asymmetry. Obstacles to effective HVF testing include patient factors such as poor concentration, dementia, and other mental and physical problems as well as clinician factors such as the high cost of an automated threshold perimeter, time to achieve useful results, and training technicians to operate the device and gather reliable data.</p>
 <p>A limitation of this study was incomplete records for HVF MD and PSD. Patient charts showed that more than 80% of patients had HVF satisfactorily completed. HVF reports are given to the patient and copies were not consistently made for the clinician records. All available results were reliable and unreliable results were repeated at the clinic’s expense. We acknowledge this reduced the power of our findings.</p>

 <h2 id="_i18" class="section-heading-2">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>Comparisons of two POAG glaucoma groups at different stages of disease severity were undertaken to identify associations between clinical findings. Significant differences were found between IOP, CDR, MD and PSD values. HVF is predictive of pretreated IOP, CDR, and severity of POAG and it is strongly encouraged as part of the standard glaucoma work up in all Ghanaian patients.</p>
