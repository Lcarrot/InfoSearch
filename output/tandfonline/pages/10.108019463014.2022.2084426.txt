 <h2 id="_i3" class="section-heading-2">1. Introduction</h2>
 <p>In this article, we focus on the opportunities afforded to students for negotiating and making meaning of the disciplinary language of social studies in linguistically diverse classrooms in which the majority language is used in teaching. Furthermore, we draw attention to interactional exchanges about the meaning of subject-related vocabulary as a salient part of classroom discourse. More specifically, we highlight how Grade 6 students (12 or 13-year-olds), supported by a teacher and one of the researchers, negotiate disciplinary vocabulary encountered in a civics textbook through interaction and the use of online dictionaries. The students comprised both L1 and L2 learners that received instruction in Swedish. A key concern in such classrooms, common throughout Sweden, is the opportunities afforded to the students for participating in and successively appropriating subject-related discourse. There has been an awareness in second-language education of the risks of creating downward spirals through the simplification of content and an over-emphasis on the decontextualized drilling of vocabulary or knowledge about grammar (discussed in Cummins <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>; Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Hajer and Meestringa <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0012" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Karlsson, Nygård Larsson, and Jakobsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0020" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>).</p>
 <p>From the perspective of disciplinary literacy, knowledge of subject-related vocabulary and patterns of language is necessary to engage in disciplinary literacy practices (Fang and Schleppegrell <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). In addition, this linguistic knowledge is gained not through decontextualized processes of reading and writing, but by engaging in social disciplinary practices involving the use of written language (Shanahan and Shanahan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>). The complex considerations involved in employing a language-focused mode of teaching content knowledge are at the core of this article. We particularly focus on engaging with disciplinary language in social studies textbook material through oral interaction and peer group activities.</p>
 <p>Recent research has focused largely on the negotiation of technical language in science classrooms (e.g. Axelsson and Jakobson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0002" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Maton and Doran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0034" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2022</a></span>; Nygård Larsson and Jakobsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0041" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Uddling <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>). Research into disciplinary literacy in social studies has tended to foreground history (e.g. Matruglio <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Shanahan and Shanahan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>; Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0052" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>; Walldén and Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021b</a></span>). This indicates a need for more research into students’ opportunities for developing disciplinary literacy in other areas of social studies teaching. On the topic of engagement with texts in the teaching of civics, a previous article, partly based on the same material as the present undertaking (Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0053" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>), showed that whole-class discussions about the textbook material perpetuated national and Western-centric perspectives on the content that might be particularly problematic in classrooms with large percentages of students from migrant backgrounds. This aligns with international research problematizing the use of social studies teaching material promoting colonial perspectives, including deficit perspectives on life in other countries (Marmer et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0026" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Mikander <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0036" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>; Odebiyi and Sunal <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0042" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). Although these studies raise important points about the national character of social studies subjects, they do not explore the negotiation of disciplinary language.</p>
 <p>The purpose of the present study is to contribute knowledge about how subject-related language in civics teaching is negotiated in classroom interactions. In particular, we address the following questions:</p>
 <ol class="NLM_list NLM_list-list_type-order" id="list_0001">
  <li><p class="inline">What knowledge about language and word meanings is negotiated in discussions about vocabulary from the civics textbook material?</p></li>
  <li><p class="inline">How do discussions about subject-related vocabulary support discursive shifts between everyday and disciplinary ways of using language that clarify the contextual meaning of the word or expression?</p></li>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p>In Sweden, civics <i>(samhällskunskap)</i> is one of four subjects within social studies, the others being history, religion, and geography. While being historically intertwined, the subjects are taught and assessed with a more disciplinary focus since the 2011 compulsory school curriculum was introduced (discussed in Samuelsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0043" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). However, the disciplinary culture among primary school teachers is weak compared to that of secondary schooling (Kristiansson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Civics in particular is often perceived as vaguely defined in relation to the other subjects. Though it has been suggested that civics teaching should focus on the concept of society and analytical thinking related to societal concepts (Blanck &amp; Lödén, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), researchers have pointed out that civics lacks a corresponding university discipline (Blanck <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). Furthermore, an interview study of primary school teachers showed that civics was attributed few distinguishing markers and was primarily perceived as having an assisting role, particularly for geography and history (Kristiansson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0021" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0022" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Classroom research on the on-going teaching of civics is generally scarce (discussed in Blanck <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0003" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Lindh <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0024" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>).</p>

 <h2 id="_i4" class="section-heading-2">2. Learning technical and academic vocabulary in subject teaching</h2>
 <p>Expanding vocabulary is widely considered one of the most important factors determining academic achievement (e.g. Ardasheva and Tretter <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0001" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>; Hirsch <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0017" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Milton and Treffers-Daller <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0037" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nation <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). However, the promotion of vocabulary learning can be seen from both a general and a disciplinary perspective.</p>
 <p>On a general level, teachers need to create opportunities for meaningful input and output (Nation <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>) and promote strategies for guessing the meaning of words, such as retrieving meaning from the context and taking cues from different parts of words such as affixes (e.g. LaBontee <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Such strategies can be promoted through language-focused learning activities (Loewen <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0025" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Nation <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). Using knowledge about word parts is particularly important in languages such as Swedish, which has a relatively rich morphology and promotes extensive use of compounding; for example, the term ‘coffee filter’ is orthographically represented as one word in Swedish (<i>kaffefilter</i>) (Enström <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). Another important strategy for L2 students involves using dictionaries and online resources to look up the meaning of unknown words. However, learning to use dictionaries in a competent and effective way requires teacher support (Nation <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>).</p>
 <p>The question of vocabulary becomes more complex when seen from the perspective of disciplinary literacy. Crucially, understanding and using field-specific terms have been identified as key components of knowledge building (e.g. Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). Interpreting disciplinary language means engaging with technical terms that clearly point to the disciplinary field studied (Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>). In order to properly understand technical language, mere definition of terminology is not sufficient; it is also necessary to understand semantic relations to other terms, for example the relationship between <i>capitalism</i> and <i>communism</i> (Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0031" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Another challenge is abstract language, involving terms that can have different meanings in different contexts, for example nominalizations such as ‘demonstration’ (cf. ‘demonstrate’). Such shifts between grammatical categories are often encountered in the teaching of social studies (see Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>[1990] 1993</a></span>) and will be further discussed in a coming section. Furthermore, students need to interpret words found across disciplinary contexts but seldom used in everyday language. This academic language notably includes what Systemic-Functional Linguistics terms relational processes (e.g. ‘consist of’, ‘involve’, ‘affect’, see Halliday et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). These play a central role in representing logical relations between technical terms and the role of these terms in subject-specific processes. All of these factors contribute to the increased complexity of learning vocabulary as part of developing disciplinary literacies.</p>
 <p>Oral classroom interaction is an important resource for making sense of academic, subject-related language. Previous studies have employed Systemic-Functional Linguistics (SFL) and Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) to describe classroom discourse in terms of <i>semantic waves</i>, or as an interactional strategy of bridging everyday and disciplinary discourses (e.g. Macnaught et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). This research has often found downward shifts, meaning that teachers unpacked technical and abstract discourse, using examples and resources of every-day language, but rarely demonstrated how everyday words and expressions could be re-packed, by upward shifts, into more complex and abstract ways of expressing disciplinary content (e.g. Hipkiss <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Maton <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). Confirming this pattern, previous studies of social studies teaching in Grade 6 have highlighted that disciplinary terms relating to living conditions and history were discussed according to simple verbal definitions (Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0051" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>) or generic visual illustrations (Walldén and Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021b</a></span>) rather than in terms of how they are used in disciplinary texts. Since disciplinary discourse connected to social studies relies heavily on abstraction (e.g. Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>[1990] 1993</a></span>), the understanding of subject-specific vocabulary is more dependent on the context, such as the particular topic of a disciplinary text.</p>
 <p>In various stages of schooling, recent research has highlighted the importance of teachers’ awareness of disciplinary language to shape the opportunities for students to engage in disciplinary literacy practices (e.g. Humphrey <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Matruglio <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Uddling <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0052" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). In addition, a study of second-language instruction (Walldén and Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0055" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021b</a></span>) has shown the importance of learning disciplinary language in tandem with interpreting challenging disciplinary texts. As pointed out by Martin (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), technical and academic vocabulary features in texts storing ‘the explanations and descriptions constituting the field’. From this perspective, both technical terms and more general features of academic registers are considered subject-related and crucial to successful engagement in disciplinary literacy practices.</p>
 <p>While a few previous studies have highlighted teachers’ interactional support for providing access to the disciplinary language of civics (e.g. Blanck <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Ernst-Slavitt and Morrison <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) and more language-focused teaching strategies in the teaching of social studies (Zhang <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0057" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), the present study will provide a more detailed analysis of interactional exchanges in civics teaching that also highlights the students’ peer group strategies for making sense of disciplinary language.</p>

 <h2 id="_i5" class="section-heading-2">3. Theoretical framework</h2>
 <p>Our understanding of disciplinary literacy in the present study is that general literacy skills, such as those strategies for interpreting and learning words discussed in the previous section, interplay with the specific disciplinary literacy skills necessary for acquiring and expressing knowledge in a given disciplinary field (Shanahan and Shanahan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0044" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>; Stålnacke <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>). As Shanahan and Shanahan (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>) point out, general skills, such as categorizing words and listing synonyms, are not sufficient to develop an understanding of discipline-specific distinctions in vocabulary use. Inspired by the notion of discourse-bridging interaction as a valuable form of contextual scaffolding (see Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Hammond and Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>), our point of departure is that oral interaction is crucial to promote students’ negotiation and active use of disciplinary language. As also pointed out by previous research on civics teaching (Ernst-Slavitt and Morrison <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0008" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Blanck <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0005" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>), an important factor is the promotion of functional connections between disciplinary vocabulary and the students’ different languages, knowledges, and experiences (Cummins <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>; Hammond and Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). From the perspective of disciplinary literacy, this interaction can highlight the semantic properties of the words used, including semantic relations to connected terms, and their contextual use in a specific knowledge field (Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0039" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).</p>
 <p>The discourse-bridging potentials in oral interaction are also highlighted in the semantic dimension of Legitimation Code Theory (LCT), which conceptualizes knowledge-building as a variable combination of contextual dependency and complexity of meaning (Maton <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). Contextual dependency refers to the degree to which meaning relates to its context and involves shifts between <i>concrete</i> and <i>abstract</i> meanings, as well as between <i>specific</i> and <i>general</i> counterparts (within LCT described as a variable strength of semantic gravity). Complexity of meaning refers to the degree of complex meaning relations and <i>condensation</i> of meaning (described in LCT as a variable strength of semantic density). In classroom discourse, dynamic movements and shifts between concrete, specific, general, abstract, and dense meanings have been described and visualized as <i>semantic waves</i>, in which the two dimensions (contextual dependency and complexity of meaning) are condensed into one (Maton <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). A related concept is <i>discursive mobility</i>, denoting the ability to move between and within different discourses, and gradually appropriate their inherent, specific ways of thinking, acting, and expressing disciplinary knowledge (Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0039" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). In our analysis of classroom interaction, we use the concepts of discursive mobility and semantic waves to describe the opportunities afforded to the students to move between concrete, specific, general, abstract, and dense meanings, meaning between and within everyday and disciplinary ways of using language, in order to learn the disciplinary content and discourse. In order to highlight these discursive shifts<a href="#en0001"><sup>1</sup></a> and the opportunities created for discursive mobility, we employ the Systemic-Functional Linguistics (SFL) perspective on language as a resource for meaning-making. We focus on the negotiation of ideational or experiential meaning in the interaction (see Halliday and Mathiessen <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0014" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Martin and Rose <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0029" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>). It follows that we view the discursive shifts and movements between discourses as corresponding to shifts in linguistic <i>registers</i> (Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0031" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>), for example when a teacher rephrases a students’ contribution in a more technical or abstract way (Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). A key concept is the <i>grammatical metaphor</i>, denoting the shifts between grammatical categories characteristic of disciplinary language (Halliday <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>[1989] 1993</a></span>; Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0030" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). For example, a process such as ‘declare’ can be transformed to a thing (‘declaration’) and placed into an expanded noun phrase connected to a specific field: ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights’. In addition, processes such as ‘bind’ (in Swedish, <i>binda</i>) can shift into qualities (‘bound’, in Swedish <i>bunden</i>) which, in the Swedish language, often form part of single-word compounds (e.g. <i>regelbunden</i>, ‘rule-bound’, cf. <i>regular</i>). Grammatical metaphors are a significant feature of the abstract and dense language associated with social studies (Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0027" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>[1990] 1993</a></span>) and are of crucial interest in the un-packing (downward shifts), and re-packing (upward shifts), of abstract language. Thus, they are associated with semantic waves and discursive mobility in disciplinary literacy practices (Macnaught et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Maton <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).</p>
 <p>While we agree that general literacy skills pertaining to vocabulary tend to be emphasized at the expense of disciplinary literacy skills (see Shanahan and Shanahan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>), general knowledge about word formation can be useful in encountering abstract disciplinary language. If students successfully identify part of a compound or a prefix denoting a nominalization, they may be able to approach the meaning of the word (LaBontee <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>; Nation <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>). Therefore, in our analysis, we explore the students’ opportunities to negotiate both general knowledge about language and the specific meanings and contextual uses of disciplinary vocabulary.</p>

 <h2 id="_i6" class="section-heading-2">4. Method and material</h2>
 <p>In the present study, ethnographically-inspired methods (see Fangen <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>) have been used to document how the students were supported in negotiating the meaning of disciplinary vocabulary in civics teaching. In this section, we describe the participants, material, and analytical approach of the study.</p>
 <div id="s0004-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i7">4.1. Participants</h3>
  <p>The study involved one teacher and 40 Grade 6 students (12 or 13-year-olds) in two different classrooms. The choice of school, located in a socially segregated area,<a href="#en0002"><sup>2</sup></a> was based on knowledge of the school considering it a pedagogical priority to provide interactional support for students when dealing with content-area texts. Another consideration was that, according to official statistics, 50% of the students had a ‘foreign background’, meaning they were either born in a country other than Sweden or had both parents born outside Sweden. While we collected no specific information about the students’ individual backgrounds or linguistic resources, the teacher gave group-level information confirming that the linguistic diversity reflected the substantial migration to Sweden from different parts of the world and that the most of the students with foreign background were considered second-language learners.<a href="#en0003"><sup>3</sup></a> The participant teacher was followed because she, as the leader of a team of teachers, was a driving force in developing the school’s scaffolding pedagogy with a focus on promoting discussions about subject-related texts and concepts. Thus, the teacher could be presumed to provide rich opportunities for interaction, which aligned with our aim of contributing knowledge about how subject-related language in civics teaching is negotiated in classroom interactions. Furthermore, she had a stated interest in collaborating with researchers.</p>
  <p>The chosen location and participants were able to provide exemplary knowledge (see Thomas <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0048" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>) of teachers’ supporting linguistically diverse students to engage with disciplinary texts and vocabulary when taught in the majority language (Swedish). In other words, we sought to provide particular representations of students’ negotiating disciplinary vocabulary, which other researchers and teachers can recognize and make connections to, based on their own practices and contexts (Thomas <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0047" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>). Generally, the L2 learners in the study had not recently arrived in the country, but rather had already experienced some years of schooling in Sweden. In accordance with other staff at the school, the teacher stressed the importance of providing support to all students, not just the students with Swedish as a second language. In this article, the term ‘linguistically diverse classroom’ is used to describe the present classrooms that were shared between L1 and L2 learners of Swedish.</p>
  <p>The participant teacher was certified in teaching Swedish, English, and social studies. She was aware of the researcher’s interest in classroom discussions about disciplinary texts and concepts. Some preliminary analyses of the material presented in the study were shared with the teacher, which she described as beneficial for her understanding of word comprehension strategies and disciplinary language.</p>
  <p>From an ethical standpoint, the study was conducted in accordance with principles advocated by the Swedish Research Council (2017). The first author sought and received written consent from all participants in the study, including written consent from students’ caregivers. Students were informed orally before the study began. To ensure the caregivers’ comprehension of the nature of the study, including expected publications forms, the possibility to withdraw participation, and the processing of personal data in the form of audio recordings, information was given both in adapted writing and orally during annual progress discussions between the teacher and students’ caregivers. Audio recordings and transcripts were stored in secured ways according to the university regulations. As participant observer, the researcher sought the students’ continuous assent to participate (see Tracy <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0049" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>) by asking their permission to participate in the peer group discussions while recording them and taking photos. From the perspective of relational ethics (Tracy <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0049" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>), the researcher strived to act responsibly to the students and the teacher, for example by providing support when the students asked for help (see below) in a way which did not disrupt the direction of the teaching or the teacher’s expressed intentions.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0004-s2002" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i8">4.2. Material</h3>
  <p>The first author collected the material by way of field notes, transcribed audio recordings (16 hours), screenshots of iPads, and the documentation of teaching material during 16 civics lessons spanning five weeks. During the study, the researcher mostly took the role of observer on the observer-participant cline (see Fangen <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0010" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>), seated either at the back of the classroom or, in peer-group activities, next to the students, while taking notes and managing a digital audio recorder. However, in some of the peer-group discussions, the researcher provided some linguistic support when students asked questions about the meaning of disciplinary words and expressions. This occasionally shifted the researcher’s role to a more participating role in which the researcher drew on experience of teaching Swedish as a second language. In the results, we highlight parts of these unplanned interactions. In addition, the documentation of the peer group discussions involved taking screenshots of searches on iPads. These were directly aimed at the iPad screens, not capturing the students. The audio recording was focused on the student groups in which the researcher participated, guided by the teacher’s advice on groups with both L1 and L2 learners of Swedish.</p>
  <p>The specific instances of interaction focused on in the present study occurred during three lessons (3 hours 40 minutes) centred on a textbook spread, concerning the United Nations and the Declaration of Human Rights, which the teacher considered particularly dense with difficult words. The vocabulary had not been presented or discussed earlier, but the teacher had led a whole-class discussion about headings and images on the relevant textbook spread. In addition, she had briefly explained what the United Nations is and shown a video clip about UNICEF. Both organizations feature on the spread. It follows that the students had some prior knowledge of the content. The peer group activity involved students searching for the meaning of words and negotiating their meaning in peer interaction, marking the only instance observed in which the teacher asked the students to note down and discuss unfamiliar subject-related words. The 40 students were divided into two classrooms and the activity played out similarly in both. However, just one lesson was followed in one of the classrooms. The textbook used in instruction is <i>Puls Samhällskunskap</i> (<i>Pulse Civics</i>) (Stålnacke <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0046" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>), which is part of a high-profile series from a large publisher of textbooks in Sweden. The studied teaching mainly focused on sections concerning globalization, international cooperation, living conditions, and human rights. A more comprehensive view of the teaching is given in another article (Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0053" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>) which focuses on whole-class discussions about the textbook material. Those discussions emphasized visual text features such as headings and images rather than verbal language. Therefore, they were not incorporated in the present article.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="s0004-s2003" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i9">4.3. Analytical approach</h3>
  <p>The transcripts were read through multiple times by both researchers, with a focus on our aim of contributing knowledge about how disciplinary language in social studies is negotiated in classroom interaction. In choosing relevant excerpts for closer analysis, we were interested in the approaches that the students – following the teacher’s direction – used to arrive at the meaning of words. The different approaches, such as using online dictionaries or requesting aid from adults, had consequences for the knowledge about language and word meanings negotiated in the discussions (RQ1). Furthermore, we were interested in the interactional support given by the adults, and discursive shifts between everyday and disciplinary ways of using language. This relates to how the discussions about subject-related vocabulary supported discursive shifts between everyday and disciplinary ways of using language (RQ2). Finally, the choice of examples reflects the linguistic challenges in the textbook as perceived by the students, comprising both words and expressions with subject-specific meaning and examples of general academic vocabulary. As can be expected, both categories featured in the register of the civics textbook material and in the words marked as unknown by the students.</p>
  <p>In sum, the chosen excerpts exemplify student approaches to negotiating disciplinary vocabulary and the role of interaction in supporting discursive shifts. This is reflected in the two major sections of the findings, <i>Decontextualizing word meaning according to a thesaurus approach</i> (emphasis on RQ1) and <i>Contextualizing disciplinary vocabulary through interactional support</i> (emphasis on RQ2). To ensure internal consistency, separate initial readings, analyses, and choices of excerpts were conducted and later conferred upon.</p>
  <p>As previously described, we used the concept of <i>discursive mobility</i> (see Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0039" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2011</a></span>) to analyse how the words marked as unknown by the students were negotiated in the oral interaction. In accordance with RQ2, we were interested in occurrences, or non-occurrences, of discursive shifts. This involved possible definitions, as well as downward and upward discursive shifts, including unpacking and re-packing of grammatical metaphors, as part of <i>semantic waves</i> (see Macnaught et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Maton <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0032" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). As stated in the Theoretical framework section, this entailed SFL-based analysis of the level of register. We were also interested in the teacher’s and students’ orientation to interpreting words, particularly if it reflected an orientation to general literacy skills for understanding words or to their particular disciplinary context and use. This aligns with RQ1, which concerns the knowledge about language and word meanings negotiated in the discussions about vocabulary from the civics textbook material. Therefore, we have also focused on how the interaction relates to or deviates from the particular knowledge field focused on in instruction.</p>
  <p>The transcribed interactions shown in the excerpts presented in this study have been translated from Swedish to English in ways that preserve crucial aspects of the linguistic analysis, such as the occurrences of grammatical metaphors. Since compounding is more prevalent in Swedish than in English, and orthographically different, some compounds have been translated both idiomatically and literally. The excerpts in Swedish are included in <a href="#app0001">Appendix A</a>.</p>

 <h2 id="_i10" class="section-heading-2">5. Result</h2>
 <p>In this section, we highlight the interaction of Grade 6 students negotiating subject-related vocabulary encountered in the civics textbook spread. Placed in groups of three or four, the students were asked to individually note down words from the text that they did not understand. The subsequent interaction primarily focused on words marked as unknown by the students. The teacher had asked the students to ‘look up’ the meaning of the words. For this purpose, she handed out iPads.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="_i11">5.1. Decontextualizing word meaning according to a thesaurus approach</h3>
  <p>In the studied interactions, the students generally used the iPads to search on Google for the words and expressions, often leading to definitions from web pages displayed directly in the search results and links to <i>synonymer.se</i>, an online thesaurus. In Excerpt 1, a student group was googling the meaning of ‘deklaration’ (<i>Declaration</i>), in the textbook referring to the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In the excerpt, the word ‘förklaring’ – not used in the textbook material but encountered by students when searching online – is untranslated from Swedish. The most common meaning of this term is ‘explanation’, while it can also be synonymous with ‘declaration’. In the transcripts, participants are represented by ‘S’ (students, sometimes numbered), ‘T’ (teacher), and ‘R’ (researcher). Quotations marks indicate original language wording.</p>

   <p>When using Google to search for the meaning of <i>deklaration</i> (declaration), the students encountered equally abstract terms, such as ‘decree’ (line 17), ‘edict’ (l. 31), and the nominalization ‘proclamation’ (l. 32). Several of these terms, such as ‘tax return’ (l. 18) and ‘income declaration’ (l. 2), belong to a different knowledge field within civics. When S1 turned to the researcher for help with an abstract definition of ‘income declaration’, the researcher encouraged the students to change track by pointing out the contextual meaning of the word (l. 4–7). Instead, one of the students seemed to latch on to the researcher’s explanation of the term ‘income declaration’ (l. 10). In visiting the group, the teacher also pointed out the polysemy of the term: ‘it could mean many different things’ (l. 12–13). Remarking on the abstract synonyms encountered by the students, she tried to support them in two different ways: by drawing attention to the English term (l. 21), and by asking the students to do ‘detective work’ by taking cues from how the term was used in the book: ‘look how it is written here and try to think hmm what it possibly could mean’ (l. 30–31). S2 kept listing synonyms (l. 32–33), while S1 seemed to settle for ‘statement’ as a suitable synonym, replacing ‘declaration’ in his paraphrase of the book: ‘some articles from UN’s statements’ (l. 34). An added complexity in the negotiation of the Swedish terms is the term <i>förklaring</i>, encountered in the online search, which in itself is polysemic (discussed above). In the interaction, the teacher affirmed <i>förklaring</i> without relating to the common, everyday meaning ‘explanation’ (l. 15). For this reason, when S2 concluded the exchange with “How you ‘<i>förklarar’</i>” – thus unpacking it as a process (cf. ‘explain’) – it is unclear whether this reflected an understanding of ‘declaration’ according to its disciplinary use in the civics textbook (l. 34). Overall, none of the synonyms, including <i>förklaring</i>, served to unpack the meaning of ‘declare’ by bringing it closer to everyday language use. Thus, the discussion did not support discursive shifts that could have contributed to a clarification of the contextual meaning of the word.</p>
   <p>The orientation towards word meanings showed what we choose to term a thesaurus approach, decontextualizing the meaning of subject-related words from their use in the relevant disciplinary field. Consequently, students had to negotiate knowledge about several abstract word meanings rather than one. In addition, opportunities for both interpreting disciplinary text and using disciplinary language in spoken interaction were limited. Even when the teacher referred the students to the book, the purpose seemed to be to uncover the meaning of the word rather than to successfully interpret the text. While S1 finally seemed to settle on a suitable synonym, the need to navigate many unrelated abstract word meanings limited opportunities for unpacking the abstract and dense word <i>declaration</i> into more subject-related, specific, and concrete meanings.</p>
   <p>A thesaurus approach is also evident in Excerpt 2, in which a student requested help to understand the word <i>bestå</i>. In isolation, it means ‘subsist’ or ‘endure’, but most commonly occurs in the phrasal verb <i>bestå av</i>, meaning ‘consist of’.</p>

   <p>In her initial contribution, using resources of everyday language, S2 successfully paraphrased and unpacked the meaning of <i>består av</i> (‘consist of’”), a relational process often encountered in academic discourse (l. 2). The verb group contains the particle ‘av’. However, the teacher complicated the interaction by pointing out the possibility of a different – and rarely used – meaning of <i>består</i> without the particle (l. 7, 13–14, cf. ‘subsist’, ‘endure’). She again referred the students to the text material to ascertain the correct meaning. As was evident in the interaction based on ‘deklaration’, the students were exposed to polysemy in a way that could muddle gaining knowledge of the word’s contextual use. With a slightly more textual approach to the task, for example by instructing the students to mark the unknown word in the text instead of writing down isolated words, uncertainties such as that in Excerpt 2 could have been avoided.</p>

   <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="_i18">Excerpt 3. Unpacking the word ‘levnadsstandard’</h4>
   <p>As in the interaction based on ‘deklaration’, the students appeared to have difficulty negotiating the definitions encountered when googling the meaning of ‘levnadsstandard’ (standard of living). While there is no added complexity of polysemy, the definitions and explanations laboriously articulated by the students contained abstract and dense subject-related words such as ‘living conditions’, ‘inhabitants’, and ‘gross domestic product’ (l. 2–3, 10–12). However, the teacher did not seem to recognize the challenge this presented to the students, merely prompting them to explain to each other (l. 4–5). Clearly, peer interaction could not support an understanding of the meaning of the term (l. 13–14). Instead, they turned to the researcher for aid (l. 16), who pointed out the word as a compound: ‘They are put together’ (l. 21). Focusing on the first part of the word, the root morpheme <i>levnad</i>, S3 successfully paraphrased and unpacked it into more everyday and concrete discourse, as ‘the way in which you live’ (l. 24). Not paying attention to S1’s continued reading from the result screen, she elaborated and specified, using resources of everyday language: ‘The way you use your money … and so on’ (l. 27–28). While this unpacked the grammatical metaphor ‘living’ in a content-relevant way, it did not show understanding of the compound as a whole. However, when the researcher asked about familiarity with the second part of the word (<i>standard</i>) (l. 29), S1 successfully paraphrased it as ‘level’ (l. 31), enabling S3’s subsequent unpacking of the word <i>levnadsstandard</i> (standard of living): ‘the level you live on’ (l. 32). This unpacking supported discursive shifts between every-day and disciplinary ways of using language that clarified the meaning of the term.</p>
   <p>In this instance, the interaction involving an adult provided support for learning the meaning of the term. Rather than being restricted to online searches, the students were made aware of the constituents of the word in a way that facilitated their arrival at the desired meaning. The interaction involved both knowledge about compounding and, more implicitly, grammatical metaphors. Although the researcher did not refer the students to the book, the interaction was more centred on field-relevant meanings than previous examples. The likely reason for this is that ‘standard of living’ relates more closely to social studies than, for example, ‘consist of’ (common in academic language) and ‘declaration’ (having several different meanings).</p>
   <p>In another observed peer group talk (Excerpt 4), the teacher provided linguistic support of a different sort. The term in question is again ‘standard of living’.</p>

   <p>In her explanation, S1 used resources of everyday language to convey an understanding of the term: ‘place to live’, ‘enough food’, ‘have an okay way of living’ (l. 3–5). In her follow-up, the teacher prompted the student to define it as ‘high’ or ‘low’ standards of living (<i>hög eller låg levnadsstandard</i>) (l. 6). In other words, she requested an expansion of the noun group to show a more precise understanding. Thus, the student’s contribution was rephrased, re-packed and elaborated on in a more abstract and content-relevant way. After confirming the students’ suggestion of ‘average’, she followed up using resources of everyday language to give concrete and specific examples of what constitutes ‘high’ and ‘low’ standard of living (‘ … you can afford to buy a <i>house</i>, a <i>car</i>, and nice <i>clothes</i> and so on’) (l. 9–10), then reiterating the abstract expanded noun groups: ‘we have a <i>high</i> standard of living’ (l. 10–11). With these downward and upward shifts, by unpacking and re-packing the abstract concept of standard of living, the interaction formed a semantic wave, and the teacher displayed and promoted a high degree of discursive mobility, while also clarifying the metaphorical use of ‘high’ and ‘low’ in this context. Thus, this exchange involved negotiation of both grammatical and lexical metaphors in a way that connected to the field studied. The field-negotiating approach taken here stands in contrast to the decontextualizing thesaurus approach discussed in the previous section.</p>
   <p>Interactional support promoting a more nuanced understanding of a word was also evident in an exchange about ‘regular’. The Swedish word, <i>regelbunden</i> (approximately ‘rule-bound’), is a compound enabled by a grammatical metaphor (from the process <i>binda</i>, see Theory section). It is an abstract word, which in itself does not point to any specific disciplinary context. In the textbook material, it occurs in a paraphrase of Article 22 of the UDHR: ‘Elections should be held regularly’.</p>

   <p>As in the interaction based on ‘standard of living’ and ‘declaration’, the students read out abstract definitions – in most cases, grammatical metaphors – encountered when using the iPad (l. 3–4). S2 offered a definition showing some insight of the meaning, unpacking it into more every-day concrete wording as ‘you do it now and then’ (l. 5). Picking up on this definition, the teacher gave a lengthy example of an irregular interval – using resources of everyday language to give concrete and specific examples (‘ … do something the second week in June’ …) – asking the students if it represented ‘regular’ or ‘now and then’ (l. 7–10). S2 confirmed it as ‘now and then’ (l. 11) and offered that ‘it must be like the same day’ to be regular (l. 13). Thus, through interactional discourse-bridging support, the students approached the meaning targeted by the teacher.</p>
   <p>In this case, the teacher put the word into a context to make its meaning clearer, drawing attention to how ‘now and then’ is not quite the same thing as ‘regular’. The movements between reiteration of the term ‘regular’ and the way it was unpacked in everyday language constituted discursive shifts. However, as in several of the previous examples, the term was not discussed according to how it was used in the textbook material: regular elections as part of universal human rights. As such, the interaction still related quite weakly to the disciplinary context provided by the textbook material and limited students’ opportunity to gain knowledge of the contextual meaning of <i>regularly</i>. Referring to and clarifying the sentence ‘Elections should be held regularly’ would offer an opportunity for more specific elaborations and potentially a concluding upward discursive shift, related to the field studied.</p>

 <h2 id="_i23" class="section-heading-2">6. Discussion</h2>
 <p>Overall, the results highlight the issue of abstract meanings encountered in social studies textbook material not being adequately contextualized in classroom interaction and on-going teaching. While previous research has shown the linguistic challenges associated with content learning and interactional strategies for the students’ successive appropriation of subject-related discourse (Macnaught et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>), the present study shows that some linguistic challenges are unconducive for opening textual pathways to disciplinary learning. In relation to the knowledge about language and word meanings negotiated in the discussions (RQ1), the findings have shown that the students used a thesaurus approach by using online searches to find out the meaning of words in the textbook material. This strategy was encouraged by the teacher and presented the students with multiple abstract meanings, in many cases unrelated to the content studied. As such, the input from the online thesaurus was incomprehensible and became a detour to making meaning of content-relevant use of the words in the civics textbook. Even when the researcher and the teacher asked students to consider the contextual and disciplinary use of the words, the process of decontextualisation resulting from the orientation to finding and discussing synonyms did not provide opportunities to concretize and elaborate on disciplinary meanings. This shows the limitations inherent in generic literacy approaches to content learning (Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>; Shanahan and Shanahan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>; Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0056" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2022</a></span>).</p>
 <p>In other exchanges (Excerpts 3–5), the teacher and researcher intervened in ways that enabled the students to unpack and contextualize abstract words. Thus, the discussions supported discursive shifts between everyday and disciplinary ways of using language (RQ2). We have shown how the researcher pointed out different parts of an abstract, compounded grammatical metaphor (<i>levnadsstandard</i> – ‘standard of living’), enabling the students to arrive at the meaning by unpacking the abstract, nominalized language into a more everyday and concrete discourse (‘the way in which you live’; ‘the way you use your money’; ‘the level you live on’). In another exchange, the teacher’s interactional support contextualized the term in a content-relevant way by expanding the noun group (‘high or low standard of living’; that is, <i>hög eller låg levnadsstandard)</i> and giving specific examples of a high standard of living (‘you can afford to buy a <i>house</i>, a <i>car</i>, and nice <i>clothes</i> and so on’). This formed distinct semantic waves (Maton <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0033" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>) between concrete meaning as well as more abstract ways of expressing disciplinary meaning. Such discursive shifts are more conducive to appropriation of subject-related words in disciplinary discourse than the simple verbal definitions highlighted in a previous study (Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0051" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). In accordance with previous research, this points to the crucial role of the discourse-bridging interactional support offered in the social practice of content-learning (Macnaught et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). It also indicates how some skills related to generic literacy, such as making use of principles for word formation (see LaBontee <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0023" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>), can be a resource for making meaning of disciplinary language. For L2 learners, teacher support can be crucial for noticing and reflecting about the meaning of word parts (Nation <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0038" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>), including constituents of verb groups (‘består av’) and compounds (‘levnadsstandard’). This is particularly true for single-word compounds which are particularly prevalent in Swedish compared to many other languages (see Enström <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0007" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). It follows that they can be an unfamiliar but important linguistic feature for learners of Swedish as a second language (e.g. Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). However, even in the scaffolding exchanges illuminating different word parts, interaction was focused on uncovering the meaning of words rather than understanding and interpreting them as part of text material storing field knowledge (see Martin <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0028" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>). This proved challenging for both words with a subject-specific meaning, (i.e. declaration, standard of living) and those which feature generally in academic language (i.e. consist of, regular). The result would probably have been very different had the teacher encouraged an in-context approach to unknown words, such as highlighting them in the textbook material.</p>
 <p>Overall, our results underscore the importance of considering the active mediation of disciplinary texts as an integral part of the on-going practice of teaching (see Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>; Hammond and Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). For example, if the meaning of ‘regular’, in itself not pointing to any particular context, had been negotiated in the disciplinary context provided by the textbook material, it would have been possible to narrow down the interaction to the relevant disciplinary area while considerably expanding the opportunities for discursive shifts; for example, by connecting regular elections to semantically related abstract concepts (see Maton and Doran <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0034" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Some examples of related concepts in the text material used in the teaching were ‘public will’, ‘voting rights’, and ‘freedom of speech’. Exploring these terms would have made the semantic difference between ‘regular’ elections and elections just ‘now and then’ significant. In addition, in linguistically diverse classrooms, a valuable resource in subject teaching and learning is to relate to students’ different experiences and backgrounds in collaborative negotiation of the content and discourse (e.g. Cummins <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0006" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>; Hammond and Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>). This potential was not consciously used in the classrooms studied despite its evident promise in relation to democratic issues and fundamental human rights of the citizens in different societies.</p>
 <p>As with other discourse-bridging strategies, using the students’ prior knowledge and experience as resources for negotiating disciplinary discourse would require the civics content, the core aspects, and central perspectives of the subject to be the point of departure (see Shanahan and Shanahan <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0045" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>), rather than isolated words that the students, prompted by the teacher, single out as difficult. As pointed out in previous research, decontextualized, language-focused activities may be counterproductive for L2 students by limiting their engagement with the cognitive challenge of disciplinary registers (e.g. Hajer and Meestringa <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0012" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>).</p>
 <p>A clear implication for teaching is that disciplinary language should be contextualized through the socially-mediated interpretation of disciplinary texts (see Walldén and Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0054" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021b</a></span>). In particular, if students are instead asked to do ‘detective work’ by focusing on the words themselves rather than the disciplinary registers they appear in, it can promote decontextualizing processes, providing high challenges but little support (see Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0011" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2006</a></span>) in understanding disciplinary discourse. The present study underscores the need for teachers to be aware of disciplinary texts and languages (Humphrey <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0018" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Matruglio <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0035" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>; Uddling <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0050" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>). The study also adds to previous research by showing that this should include an awareness of the detours to disciplinary literacy potentially created by students’ unnecessary exposure to lexical ambiguity due to words having different meanings in different contexts.</p>
 <p>Aside from online searches, the main resource offered by the teacher for understanding the disciplinary language was peer interaction. The necessary role of the adults in supporting the students’ understanding of abstract words points to the limits of this approach. In the studied teaching, the support from adults was provided in a haphazard way by the teacher stopping by and intervening or by the students’ enlisting the support of the researcher. Instead, a planned approach to the interaction (see Hammond and Gibbons <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0015" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) can be used in which the teacher takes an active role in highlighting subject-specific and academic features of language before handing over responsibility to the students.</p>
 <p>Previous classroom studies drawing on the concepts of semantic waves and discursive mobility have shown teachers’ proactively supporting the understanding and active use of disciplinary language (Hipkiss <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0016" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>; Macnaught et al. <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0019" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2013</a></span>; Nygård Larsson <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0040" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>) and teaching in which the material used did not seem to provide disciplinary input for discursive shifts (Walldén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0052" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2020</a></span>). The present study gives additional perspectives by pointing out challenges of polysemy in abstract discourse related to social studies and interactional strategies that can support students in making sense of such discourse.</p>

 <h2 id="_i24" class="section-heading-2">7. Final conclusions</h2>
 <div id="s0007-s2001" class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_2">
  <p>We believe that the results of the present study reflect a common situation in linguistically diverse Swedish classrooms, in which teachers seek strategies through focusing on vocabulary and creating opportunities for interaction. The result of this study highlights the importance of such efforts being informed by a linguistic and textual awareness in disciplinary teaching. Crucially, in the teaching of social studies, this also should include a <i>contextual awareness</i>, including the awareness that the meaning of words is dependent on several contexts: the subject-related content, discourse, and disciplinary practice, as well as the actual text and immediate sentence in which the words appear. In the teaching of civics, it means underscoring what the subject-related words mean in relation to the concept of society or as part of expressing critical thinking about society (Blanck and Lödén <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0004" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Although words such as ‘regular’ and ‘consist of’ constitute examples of general academic language, their meaning is most fruitfully negotiated in the subject-specific contexts and register patterns in which they appear (see Fang and Schleppegrell <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0009" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2010</a></span>; Halliday <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref"><a data-rid="cit0013" data-reflink="_i26 _i27" href="#"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>[1989] 1993)</a></span>. This is also true for words such as ‘declaration’ (deklaration) that have different meanings relating to the different disciplines drawn on in the school subject of civics (e.g. economics, political science) as well as synonyms connected to everyday language (‘förklaring’). The complicated task for the students, who were both L1 and L2 learners, to negotiate these different meanings is evident in the findings. The teacher’s awareness of the disciplinary context could have a crucial role in enacting a planned approach to classroom interaction that enables students to learn these words in rather than out of context. Such an approach would be valuable for all students, regardless of linguistic background.</p>
